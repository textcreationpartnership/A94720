            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have already underſtood a grand exception againſt me, for charging ſo much devotion and divinity, upon the ſex of women who are the Actors in this Scene, and the Authours of this diſcourſe, it is true upon the firſt peruſual of theſe papers, I my ſelf did little expect to finde ſuch Maſculine vigour in them: and truly, I dare boldly affirm, that the ſum of all the controverſies, that our Engliſh Schools have been wrangling, and the Pulpits railing about this hundred years, is here perfectly repreſented on both ſides; nor is it to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at, that women ſhould arive to ſuch a perfection in divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in this age, wherein all learning is almoſt become proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, when above a thouſand years ago, we finde one of the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſeſt peices of divinity, written by <hi>Athenais,</hi> who ſeemed to be that, which the Poets feigned of <hi>Pallas;</hi> ſhe was bred in Paganiſme, better acquainted with the Theogony of <hi>Heſiod,</hi> than the genealogy of Jeſus Chriſt; better skil'd in <hi>Homers</hi> Illiads, then the books of the Goſpel, and better in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thegmes of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> then the commandments af God; but ſhe became afterwards ſo skilful in the Chriſtian Law, that ſhe wrote in Homerick verſes, the principal Acts of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
<pb facs="tcp:170406:7"/>Chriſt, and even as the bleſſed <hi>Magdalen</hi> with the ſame hair, wherewith ſhe had weaved nets for wanton love, did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards turn into a Towel, to wipe the feet of our Saviour, ſo ſhe conſecrated all the Graces of her wit and learning, which ſhe had before miſimployed in vanities, to the Trophy of Jeſus. Then as to the devotion of that ſex, I conceive it leſs queſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, when women are right ſet, none can go beyond them for that. The Church hath always given to them, the title of the devout ſex, <hi>Their bleſſing is in the dew of Heaven:</hi> they reſemble Bees which are born in hony: or rather thoſe birds of the fortunate Iſlands, that breath no air but perfumes, and are onely nouriſht with incenſe: they grow wholly Angelical inſomuch as forgetting their ſex, and all their natural imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, they furniſh themſelves with the moſt perfect Ideas of divinity, and ſcarce retain any thing in them, common with matter. We find likewiſe, that great priviledges and preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives are given to them by our Saviour, for as the chaſt womb of a woman, ſerved him for a lodging, at his firſt entrance into the world, ſo when he was to iſſue out of it, amongſt ſo many horrors, and terrible images of death, when ſtones were rent in ſunder for grief under his feet, and heaven it ſelf diſtended with ſorrow, over his head, women alſo were found near to the Croſs, as witneſſes of his laſt words, and ſurvivers of his bloud; nay, they were the firſt likewiſe, that he would do the honour to appear to after his reſurrection. Now I muſt confeſs, that the prejudicators of this piece and all the devotion and divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of that ſex, carry with them a great deal of reaſon too, for there is a ſort of fisking Goſſips, who imagine devotion to he nothing but an ordinary practiſe of motions, and geſtures, ſuch as little puppets would make, if annimated with a quantity of Quickſilver, whileſt the true virtues of devotion, we know ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to S. <hi>Thomas,</hi> is nothing elſe but a prompt will to the ſervice of God. others there are of them, whoſe devotion is altogether
<pb facs="tcp:170406:7"/>ſilken, and very fine forſooth in all things, ſo coy and curious they will be in the choice of perſons, that Sacraments them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are good for nothing, if they he not tyed to ſuch and ſuch hands, where vanity ſeeks its intereſts, nay forſooth their dovo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſuch, that they will plant their prettie petite pride upon the very hair cloth of Penance, and if God would chaſtiſe ſuch creatures to their liking, he muſt be forced, to tye up his rods with ſilk, or elſe they will never receive correction from his hands. Though they riſe not till noon, yet as if they feared the vapours of the ſerain, they muſt be armed before they come out of their beds, with reſtoratives from the Kitchin, to keep their colours more freſh. Then they will ſet themſelves down to be cloathed, with their Lookingglaſſes before them, as if their fingers were too good to touch their own clothes, and yet will be dreſt up like Idols, and ſo adored too by their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, who are to ſtand about them, admiring of their beauty, which they have more ado too to preſerve, then the Veſtals of <hi>Rome,</hi> had to maintain the ſacred fire, one preſents their Ladyſhips, with white, another with red: this with ſome Serous, that with ſome Fucus, another attends the Looking-glaſs to hold it, or remove it at their Ladyſhips pleaſure, whileſt another ſtands behind to he the tell-clock, but dares not tell their Ladyſhips, that the hour of the Curch is ready to be paſt, whilſt their Ladyſhips are faſtening on their Pennons, Neck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces, or Bracelets, yet muſt the Canons of the Church be as eaſily broken, as a glaſs, to obey the humors of theſe women, and the celebration begin, when it is to be doubted, whether the Sun begin not then, to bend towards its ſetting: prayers in the Church muſt be paſt over with making of ſome ſowre faces, and looking ſcornfully with a good grace, with ſome ſlight ceremonies of devotion it may be, which go no further neither then the outward parts; There it is, where reſolutions are made of entertainments of time, to be choſen for the next
<pb facs="tcp:170406:8"/>day: then follow viſits, gaddings, coachings, dancings, &amp;c. beſides what paſſeth behind the Curtain; their husbands in the mean time, are very uncivil, as they ſay, if they give them not permiſſion to do any thing: and as it is ſaid of the Moon, that ſhe never agrees in qualities with the Sun, but when ſhe hath ecclipſed him: ſo they find no concord in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, but in the diminution of their husbands authority. Theſe are the Lady-birds that will make their husbands ſell a large patrimony, to buy them a little Cabinet, lay out thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of pounds upon a rope of Pearl, to wear about thoſe necks that do better deſerve a halter, nay their very ears, which they take a pride to ſhew little and ſlender, yet they muſt have whole Lordſhips hanging upon them. A man would ſay, to ſee how they pamper their bodies, that they were diſcended from heaven, and that thither they intended to return, without paſſing through the ſepulchre, ſo they deifie their fleſh, and to fatten and gild a dunghill covered with ſnow, they ſport with the blood and ſweat of men, what a ſight it is, to ſee theſe Ladies groan as at a torture, under the weight and ſtraightneſs of their garments, and yet for all this, will court and adore their own puniſhments. He that will take the pains to examine well the furniture of them, will think that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble thoſe birds, that have no body almoſt under a great deal of feathers, then their apparrel is made rather to ſell their bodies, then to cover them. I know not for my part, what may be reſerved for the eyes of their husbands, when through all the ſtreets and markets, the ſecret parts of their wives bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are expoſed as open, as if they were ready to be delivered over to the beſt bidders. Then the cloaths they wear, are ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant, in their head dreſſings, flying elbows, great gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets, and farthinggals, that the Church dores muſt be made wider to receive them. Theſe are the devotes of this age, that ſpend a fourth part, of their life, in dreſſing and beſmear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:170406:8"/>themſelves, to make themſelves groſs in one part and little in a nother, to raiſe terrets on their heads, and ſhackles on their hands and heels, to be as ſolicitous about adreſs, as if they had a <hi>Venetian</hi> Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth to manage. Then they are ſo imperious and proud withall, that they muſt be no more offended, than thoſe Stars, which are thought to ſend tempeſts, upon ſuch as have not humbly ſaluted them. So many hundred Communions and exhortations have not taken off, one hair of their vanities: they will eat the immortal Lamb, once or twice a week it may be, and yet daily upon all occaſions they will become Lioneſſes, in their houſes. They will lay the holy Euchariſt on their tongues, as the ſeat of the ſpouſe, and yet will not bridle or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain them from one evil word, and will ſpeak more ſlanders in one dinner time, then they eat morſels. This was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſure, that <hi>Solomon</hi> ſo divinely aſſures us, Prov. <hi>19. do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus &amp; divitiae dantur a parentibus, a domino autem uxor prudens,</hi> houſes and riches come from Parents, but a wiſe and virtuous wife from the hand of God: and ſuch doubtleſs as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks of, were our divine Dueliſts here, as for the Doctors wife here, ſhe was not after the rate of other Parſons wives, who muſt always be the beſt women in the pariſh, and take place of their Landlords and Patrons wives, if they be not Ladies forſooth, and wear better cloths two then they; no her husband was not of the common rate of Churchmen neither, who take a pleaſure to employ the patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Jeſus, the ſweat and blood of the faithful, in good cheer, exceſs and play, and ſuffer their Churches to fall to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay, the Altars to become naked, the windows ſhivered to pieces, the walls to weep, and Spiders there to ſpin their webs, Rats to run up and down, and the poor of their pariſh famiſh, whileſt I know not what little wives, or wenches, drag ſilk at their heels, at the charge of the Crucifix. Nor was our Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb facs="tcp:170406:9"/>Catholick Lady here, of a much different make, being a true widdow indeed, and wholly taken up with hoſpitalities and charities, notwithſtanding ſhe was always under a moſt ſevere perſecution here, for her conſcience. Vinegar is ſaid to be uſed for precious ſtones, which have their fire frozen over, and their luſter ecclipſed, ſo ſhe was to have a little touch of acer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bity to enlighten her virtues: ſhe was indeed like a Pearl that comes from the ſalt ſea, and beheld her ſelf involved almoſt from her birth, in great perplexities and horrible confuſions of the age, from whence ſhe alwaies aroſe with ſo much luſter, as ſhe made ſtill her adverſities, to be ſteps to the Temple of glory. Sports and feaſts were puniſhments to her, ſhe was ſeldome found in the company of men, unleſs it were ſome beggers, whoſe miſeries ſhe relieved, and perſons aſſiſted in ſickneſs and in health. Her whole heart went towards God, her feet to the divine ſervice, her hands to alms, her eyes to reading books of devotion, her arms to the exerciſe of huſwifry, and works of her ſex, and her whole body to the ſacrifices, and victims of her ſoul. Thus becauſe I was obliged not to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh our Dueliſts names, I have been bold to give you an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect character of ſome of their qualities, which I hope will diſcharge you of a prejudice againſt their following diſcourſes; and obtain at leaſt a pardon from them, if not acceptance from you, which I ſhould moſt humbly beg likewiſe, that your can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour would pleaſe to beſtow, upon the Publiſher.</p>

But ſure ſweet madame, there can be no ſuch foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as you ſpeak of, unleſs in the undoubted word of God, which you have moſt cleerly, and intirely againſt you in all particulars, and therefore your Church, does all it can to blind you by keeping that from you, ſo leading you on ſtill in errours, by an implicite faith in its doctrines, which are meer humane inventions.</p>

                     <p>Indeed Madame, I doubt not but you will finde the buſineſs ſo clear, that we ſhall never need to come to that. So the combate being mutually imbraced on both ſides, with very great kindneſs they at that time parted: ſome days after, Mrs. <hi>N.</hi> came again to viſit my La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and brought her weapons with her, and ſo began again to accoſt her. Madame, the greateſt things indifference, as I humbly conceive be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us, is about that which is indeed the greateſt concernment of our ſalvation, the moſt holy Sacrament, of our Lords Supper, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in your Church hath brought ſo many viſible and palpable abuſes, and againſt known Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, that when your Ladyſhip ſhall be once ſatisfied in thoſe, I hope we ſhall not need to proceed much further. I have here reduced thoſe abuſes into four heads; as firſt, your doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation, and affirming your Euchariſt to be the very body of Chriſt. Secondly, your giving half the Sacrament to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:170406:12"/>the people, and depriving them of the Cup. Thirdly, making your Maſs a ſacrifice; and Laſtly, for ſaying your Maſs in Latine, and not in Engliſh, or other mother tongues: and to all theſe particulars, I have brought you as I conceive ſuch appoſite Texts, and here in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſet down in this paper, that I doubt not will give your Ladyſhip juſt reaſon to ſuſpect the frauds, and groſs colluſions of your Church, in all things elſe.</p>

                           <hi>For I have received of the Lord, that which I alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered unto you, that the Lord Jeſus, the ſame night in which he was betrayed, took bread; And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and ſaid, Take eat, this is my body, which is broken for you;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:170406:18"/>you, this do in remembrance of me; and after the ſame manner alſo, he took the cup, when he had ſupped, ſaying, This cup is the New-Teſtament in my blood, &amp;c.</hi> And then to ſet the buſineſs out of all doubt concludes, <hi>He that eateth and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himſelf, not diſcerning the Lords body.</hi> Can any thing be more plain?</p>
                        <p>Then further, St. <hi>Paul,</hi> begins with a Preface, <hi>I ſpeak as to wiſe men,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.15, 16, 17.</note> judge ye what I ſay, The cup of bleſſing which we bleſs, is it not the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the body of Chriſt? The Bread which we break is it not the communion of the body of Chriſt? For we being many, are one bread, and one body; for we are all partakers of that one bread.</hi> Does not the Apoſtle here moſt clearly, and expreſly ſhew that in every particle of the conſecrated bread, the whole body of Chriſt is communicated: and as he thought them only wiſe that could underſtand that myſterie; ſo we muſt think them ſtupid that will not, and worſe then Jews that go about to pervert and torment this and other Texts, to any other ſenſe.</p>
                        <p>Over and ahove all this, conſider a little more upon that Text before cited,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.28, 29.</note> 
                           <hi>But let a man exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine himſelf, and ſo let him eat of that bread, and drink of that Cup; for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to himſelf, not diſcerning the Lords body.</hi> Here it is clear that by reaſon of the preſence of the body of Chriſt, the unworthy Receiver is dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, becauſe he ſins againſt that body. There is no man can deny, but the unworthy eater, be it
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:170406:18"/>what it will that is eaten, muſt be guilty of that which is eaten. Here St. <hi>Paul</hi> moſt clearly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that it is no ſimple bread, or ordinary nouriſhment, that is ſet upon the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, but the very body of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that who ever eats thereof ſhould be guilty of it; therefore the Apoſtle adds, <hi>not diſcerning the Lords body,</hi> that is, not diſtinguiſhing it from other food. This I am likewiſe informed by the Learned, to be the ſence of the Church in all Ages; no Primitive Chriſtian ever daring to oppoſe the clearneſs of ſo much expreſs Scripture, till one <hi>Berengarius,</hi> as they call him, had the impudence to do it, but afterwards recanted, and abjured it before the Pope, thirteen Arch-biſhops, and an hundred Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, which God grant all thoſe, that have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed his footſteps, to do likewiſe.</p>
                        <p>Now that this Tranſubſtantiation,
<note place="margin">Gen. 2.</note> or tranſele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation is no way impoſsible to be done, no nor for you to conceive, as you alledge, ſee what God hath done in the like kinde; firſt in the beginning of the world, God form'd man of the duſt of the earth, here God changed duſt into fleſh; in the ſame chapter we finde how God turn'd the rib of man into woman, a bone into fleſh.
<note place="margin">Gen. 19. Exod. 4.</note> Then <hi>Lots</hi> wife looking back is turn'd into a pillar of ſalts then <hi>Moſes</hi> threw down his Rod, and it was turn'd into a Serpent.</p>
                        <p>Then I will ſtrike the water of the River with my Rod, and it ſhall be turn'd into blood,
<note place="margin">Exod. 7.</note> and divers more ſuch mutations there are in the Old Teſtament. As for the New, we find that our Saviours firſt publick miracle was to turn water
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:170406:19"/>into wine; and this great omnipotency of his, the Devil full well knew, when he to tempt him ſaid, <hi>If thou beeſt the ſon of God, turn theſe ſtones into bread.</hi> Thus you diſpute that power in him, which the Devils themſelves acknowledge: Now as Chriſt with five little Breads, did feed five thouſand men, by making of bread by his Almighty multiplication; ſo now he feeds his whole Church of the faithful, with one Bread, that is his body Sacramentally.</p>
                        <p>Then, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> did do ſome things mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly with his body, whileſt he was upon the earth, which we cannot do with our bodies, nor can any humane reaſon comprehend, you will not dare to deny, as that he pierced the grave and Tombſtone, afterwards when he roſe from the dead, that he pierced a houſe, the doors and windows being ſhut, and that he pierced the Higheſt Heavens with his body, when he aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; all theſe things, I ſay, you will not dare to deny; yet this which is enjoyned you by the ſame Authority to believe, you are pleas'd to diſpute. What is this, but to pick and chooſe what you pleaſe your ſelves to believe? and from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a chooſer in matter of Faith, ſhall be ever a part of my Letany, <hi>Good Lord deliver me,</hi> for that, I am told, is to be a true He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick.</p>

                        <p>I ſhall likewiſe grant, that he <hi>that drinketh not his blood, as well as he that eateth not his fleſh, hath no life in him;</hi> but to a Sacramental eating and drinking, there is required ſtill a Spiritual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, according to what our Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſaid, <hi>the words that he ſpake they were ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and they were life.</hi> From whence we may

Again, our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in that Chapter of St. <hi>Johns</hi> Goſpel, treats principally of our incorporation into him, which is ſufficiently effected by our Communion in one kind, the whole Chriſt being there, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Species is not at all to be ſaid neceſſary to that incorporation with Chriſt.</p>

But howſoever the uſe was then, and there, we are ſure in the Weſtern Church the Cup was never permitted to the Laity, and that for many reaſons; Firſt conſidering the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Communicants, ſome old, ſome young, ſome weak, and ſome ſtrong, there would be great danger of ſpilling that moſt precious liquour. 2. It would be very difficult to finde a commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Veſſel, to contain a quantity equal to ſuch a
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:170406:20"/>multitude, from whence it might be taken without danger of effuſion. 3. The Sacrament under the ſpecies of Wine, could not eaſily be conſerv'd for the uſe of the ſick, becauſe it would be apt to grow ſower, and corrupt, to the moving of a nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceouſneſs and a vomit in the Receiver. 4. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great danger of effuſion it could not be eaſily carry'd from place to place, as it ſhould be to the ſick. 5. It would happen ſometimes that ſome high irreverencies would be offer'd to that moſt celeſtial and worthy Sacrament. 6. We have it related and atteſted from ſome moſt holy &amp; lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned perſons, that ſome Religious men, though Lay Brothers, were importunate to receive in both kindes; whilſt the Prieſt was in the action of the Sacrament, the Patin or Plate where the ſacred Hoſt lay appeared full of blood, to the aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſatisfaction of all the beholders; and the Petitioners gave off the importunity of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer requeſt.</p>
                        <p>Over &amp; above all this, we are to beleeve, that it was a moſt ancient cuſtom in the Primitive Church that the Laity ſhould communicate but under one ſpecies: Nay, that it came from the very Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Apoſtles, becauſe the beginning of it could never yet bee ſhew'd, nor can by any man.</p>
                        <p>Beſides, we know that there were ſome amongſt the Jews that never did, nor could drink Wine; and in ſome Chriſtian Countries there is a great difficulty, and at ſome times almoſt an impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to get any Wine.</p>
                        <p>Now as for your inference, that if the Church
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:170406:21"/>could take away one ſpecies, it might as well take away both, I utterly deny; for the whole Chriſt being no leſſe under one ſpecies than under both, and as much fruit of comfort and ſpiritual nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to be had from one, as well as the other, the Church neither does, nor can deprive any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian of the Benefit of the whole Sacrament.</p>

                        <p>Our Saviour therefore taught us in St.

                           <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi> to pray daily for our ſubſtantial Bread; no mention at all of Drink.</p>
                        <p>Then we find in the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles,</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after the Aſcention of Chriſt, that <hi>the people continued ſtedfaſtly in the Apoſtles doctrine and fellowſhip, and in breaking of bread,

                        <p>Thoſe Texts of the Apoſtle which you urge, are clear to another ſence than what you propoſe: For you are to underſtand a twofold offering of Chriſt, yet both reall and true; for in both Chriſt is truly offered and ſacrificed. The firſt way of offering is that with which he once offered his living body and blood to God the Father upon the Altar of the Croſs for the ſinnes of the whole world, and ſalvation of mankinde; and of that great offering the Apoſtle onely ſpeaks there, ſhewing the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of that ſacrifice above the ſacrifices of the Law. Of which ſacrifice ſpeaking likewiſe to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Epheſ. 5.2.</note> he ſaith, <hi>he hath given himſelf for us, an offering and a ſacrifice to God for a ſweet ſmelling ſav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>n.</hi> Now this grand oblation is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:170406:22"/>by our holy Mother the Church but once in the year, and that is Saturday in the holy week; neither is there any conſecration at all made that day of the Sacrament: But the Euchariſt that was conſecrated the former day, is then receiv'd, leſt the Church of Chriſt ſhould remain depriv'd of the comfortable fruits of our Lords Paſſion. The other way of Oblation is cleerly Sacramental, and yet nevertheleſs real, by which Chriſt is daily of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd in the Church, and receiv'd by Prieſts in the Sacrifice of the Maſs, under the Sacrament, in commemoration of the Paſſion, Dead, and that former Oblation once made upon the Croſs: So that the Prieſt in the perſon of the whole Church, doth preſent to God the Father the Oblation made by the Sonne upon the Altar of the Croſs, and him offered; and that is the Offering according to the order of <hi>Melchiſedech.</hi> However this Oblation may be but rightly call'd commemorative; not that Jeſus Chriſt is not rightly and truly offered, but becauſe he is offered here under a Sacrament, inviſibly and recordatively, in remembrance of his former Oblation, by his own command,
<note place="margin">Numb. 28.3.</note> and according to his own Inſtitution. And this is the oblation that was ſignified by the continual burnt-offering in the Old Law, in which there was a Lamb without ſpot to be offered every morning and every evening. This ſecond Oblation, I ſay, the Prieſts of Chriſt doe make daily by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Chriſt himſelfe,
<note place="margin">Luke 22.</note> grounded upon thoſe words, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me:</hi> For this word <hi>do</hi> cannot referre onely to a bare ſumption, or taking of the Sacrament, as you would have it,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:170406:23"/>but an Action and Oblation; otherwiſe they ſhould not have had the power of Conſecration by thoſe words. Chriſt perfected at once the Oblation of himſelf upon the Altar of the Croſs in one bloody Sacrifice, and by the frequent repetition of this unbloody one, the fruits and effects of the former are daily deriv'd to us: So that the Maſs is not only a repreſentation of our Lords laſt Supper, but of his Paſsion, Death, and Oblation of himſelfe; and therefore our Euchariſt is not onely a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as you ſay, but it is alſo a real Sacrifice; a Sacrament truly it is, as it does repreſent, and is taken; but a Sacrifice it is, as it is offered and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed to God; and by this reaſon our Maſs, in which this great Sacrifice is celebrated, is called a Sacrifice too.</p>

<note place="margin">Exod. 24.8.</note> for as <hi>Moſes</hi> being to confirm the Old Teſtament, <hi>took the blood of Calves and Geats,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and ſprinkled the people, ſaying, this is the blood of the Covenant which the Lord hath made with you, concerning all theſe words:</hi> So Chriſt with his own blood confirm'd his New Teſtament unto us, and enter'd into the Holy of Holyes. Beſides, there be many things of the New Teſtament, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long not at all to the Maſs, as Baptiſm, the Power of the Keyes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nay, over and above all this, it does not follow,
<note place="margin">Heb. 9.</note> that if the Maſs were a Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it ſhould be therefore no Sacrifice; for a Teſtament, according to that of the Apoſtle, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the death of the Teſtator; and the Maſs being a Teſtament, does imply the death of its Teſtator Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo by conſequence muſt involve the Oblation.</p>

                        <p>I ſhall clearly grant you again, that the Maſs is a recordation or remembrance of the Paſſion of Chriſt, but not ſo nakedly, as when a Lay perſon does ſimply communicate; but it is a remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance after this manner, as it is the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative action of the whole Paſſion.

So there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as there was a continual Sacrifice in the Old Teſtament; ſo in the Law of Grace is Chriſt our Saviour made our continual Offering, and ſhall continue ſo for ever, till Anti-Chriſt ſhall come, as our Doctors do affirm, and then it ſhall ceaſe for a while.</p>

                        <p>Now give me leave again to return you ſome proofes out of the Scriptures, of the congruity, and neceſſity, that the Maſs ſhould bee a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.</p>
                        <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">Lev. 5.6.9.14.</note> it is manifeſt that in the Old Law there was to be an offering for the ſins of the people, and it was alwaies the duty of the Prieſts to offer for their ignorances and ſins, and for their cleanſing: And what Religion was there ever ſo ſtupid, as to pretend to the ſervice of a Deity, without ſome Sacrifice, except ſome novel Chriſtians, to the very ſcandal of Jews and Turks.</p>
                        <p>Secondly:
<note place="margin">Malach. 1.10, 11.</note> The Prophet <hi>Malachy</hi> does moſt plainly Propheſie of our great Sacrifice, when he brings the Lord ſpeaking to <hi>Iſrael, I have no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in you, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, neither will I accept any offering at your hand: for from the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the Sun to the going down of the ſame my name ſhall be great amongſt the Gentiles; and in every place Incenſe ſhal be offered unto my name, &amp; a pure offering; for my name ſhall be great among the heathen, ſaith the Lord of hoſts.</hi> Is not this
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:170406:24"/>a moſt plain Prediction of the Ceſſation of the Sacrifices of the old Law, and the Inſtitution of the Sacrifice of the new Law? Nor can this be meant of that Sacrifice which Chriſt offered once upon the Croſs, becauſe the Prophet ſpeaks of a Sacrifice to be offered in every place, and ſpeaks but only of one oblation; and that is nothing, nor can be, but the pure Sacrifice of the body of Chriſt, ſo often repeared upon in our Maſſes, and upon our Chriſtian Altars.</p>
                        <p>Nay yet examine a little further in this great Prophet,
<note place="margin">Malath. 3.1, 2, 3.</note> and you will finde yet a clearer evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for our Chriſtian ſacrifice; for being about his prophecies of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> to come, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving foretold the coming of the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> before him, ſays plainly that the Lord ſhall ſuddenly come to his Temple, <hi>even the Meſſenger of the Covenant, whom you delight in, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And he ſhall ſit as a refiner and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier of ſilver; and he ſhall purifie the ſons of</hi> Levi, <hi>and purge them as gold and ſilver, that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs: Then ſhall the offerings of</hi> Judah <hi>and</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>be pleaſant unto the Lord, as in the days of old, and as in former years.</hi> What can be more plain then this Prophecy, that the Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of the world ſhould purifie his Prieſts, that is, our Evangelical ones, to offer Sacrifices, not in blood, but in righteouſneſs; which can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but our moſt holy <hi>Euchariſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> comes, yet if poſſible,
<note place="margin">Malach. 3.1, 2, 3.</note> clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer to the purpoſe, ſaying, <hi>Many ſhall be purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and made white and tryed, but the wicked
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:170406:25"/>ſhal do wickedly, &amp; none of the wicked ſhall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, but the wiſe ſhall underſtand: And from the time that the daily ſacrifice ſhall be taken away, &amp; the abomination that maketh deſolate ſet up, there ſhall be a thouſand, two hundred and ninety days.</hi> This is a clear Prophecy of the coming of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,</hi> and how long he ſhall reign, during which time the continual,
<note place="margin">Matth. 24.</note> or daily Sacrifice, and this our Saviour himſelf affirms ſhall be ſulfilled, that upon the coming of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> there ſhall be an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Ceſſation of our great ſacrifice, for almoſt four years, and nothing but deſolation of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.

                        </p>
                        <p>But yet more plainly let us hear what St.
<note place="margin">Heb. 5.1, 2, 3.</note> 
                           <hi>Paul</hi> ſays in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews; For every High Prieſt taken from amongſt men, is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts, and ſacrifices for ſins. Who can have compaſſion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; for that he himſelf alſo is compaſſed with infirmity: And by reaſon hereof, he ought as for the people; ſo alſo for himſelf, to offer for ſins.</hi> Can any thing be more plain? here the Apoſtle being to define the duty of a Prieſt; declares it to be principally to offer for ſins; and whereas you ſay, that no one man can offer for another; St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſure was of another Religion; for he ſays the Prieſt ought to offer for the Peoples, as well as for his own ſins; and to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:170406:25"/>this purpoſe I have been told by thoſe that are skil'd in Antiquity, that it has been call'd the Sacrifice of the Maſs, ever ſince the beginning of Chriſtianity: So enough I conceive ſaid, as to this point.</p>

<note place="margin">1 Cur. 14.19.</note> that by my voice I might teach others alſo, then ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand words in an unknown tongue.</hi> I pray you mark thoſe words, <hi>that I might teach others,</hi> which muſt be underſtood of Preaching, not of celebration of the Maſs, or publick Liturgy of the Church.</p>

                        <p>I anſwer as before, that the underſtanding ſo required by the Apoſtle, is principally meant of prophecying and preaching.

By which external actions of theirs it is notorious that they underſtand more of the myſteries of the Maſs, then the moſt Learned <hi>Latiniſt</hi> in the world could, not being inſtructed in the myſteries.</p>

                        <head>To the third and laſt.</head>
                        <p>As to this I might refer you for further anſwer, to what has been ſaid before: for all your arguments upon this point, touch but upon one ſtring; but I will yet ſhew you, how much uſe and edification more, the people doe receive by our Maſſe, though in Latin. Firſt, there is very much of the Holy Scripture in it, and by that the Holy Ghoſt ſpeakes, and inſtils inſtruction into our hearts, though delivered in any tongue. Then the ſcope of the whoſe Maſſe, is unknown to no body, though never ſo ignorant; for the end of the Maſſe, and principal intention of the Church, who ever hears muſt know, whether he underſtand the words more or leſſe, to be the offering of the ſacrifice, for the living and the dead, in the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the paſsion and death of our Saviour, to the glory of God, edification of his Church, and the honour of our Bleſſed Lady, and all his Saints: And why ſhould not ſo much underſtanding in a Lay perſon be enough to his edification? Nay I I am confident, that by their ſcantling of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their devotions are uſually raiſed to a greater height, than the moſt learned and intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Auditors, who pleaſe themſelves with a dry underſtanding of the words. Nay it is evident, that the devotion of a man, may be very much hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, by too much attention to words. So much I conceive enough to your Arguments, &amp; to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a Latin Maſſe to be ſufficient for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; but yet if this were all in difference between
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:170406:27"/>us, I am perſwaded the Church would eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit you to have it in your own Mother tongue; for in what language it is ſaid, is onely matter of Diſcipline: But yet I have thought good to ſend you ſome Arguments likewiſe to convince you of the congruitie and conveniencie, if not neceſſitie, that the celebration of thoſe Divine Myſteries ſhould be ſtill in Latin.</p>
                     </div>
                     <div type="subpart">
                        <p>The Scripture tels us throughout <hi>Exodus, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viticus</hi> and <hi>Numbers,</hi> with what care the people of the Jews were kept off from the holy place at the celebration of their Sacrifices; how many Veyles and Curraines there were to be between the Tabernacle and them; and none but the Prieſts ſuffered to enter; is not our great Chriſtian ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice then to be attended with as much reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence?</p>
                        <p>Nay the Prieſts themſelves went only into the firſt Tabernacle; but into the ſecond went the High Prieſt alone; and that but once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himſelfe, and for the errours of the people: Are not the Myſteries of our Faith more ſacred? I'm ſure all their Sacrifices were but types of ours; and all thoſe reverences which they payed then, were but to teach us our humble diſtance, and how to behave our ſelves before our dreadfull, and moſt myſterious ſacrifice now.</p>
                        <p>We find our Saviour in the Garden, withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf from his Diſciples, and praying fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, and ſecretly, as you may ſee both in Saint <hi>Matthews</hi> and Saint <hi>Lukes</hi> Goſpels. Hee prayed,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:170406:27"/>undoubtedly, for all the world, but his prayers were not heard, much leſſe underſtood by any.</p>
                        <p>Now that you may be better inform'd in this point of Diſcipline, I muſt tell you that our Church has been ever carefull to pay equall reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to thoſe moſt ſacred Myſteries, inſomuch as from the beginning of Chriſtianity, the people, nor yet Princes were ever ſuffer'd to come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Rayle before the Altar; and where there is no Rayle, the people are forbid to preſſe up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Altar, for fear of diſturbing him in his great celebration. Nay in the Primitive Church the Chriſtian Altars were covered with as many Curtains and Veyles as the Jewiſh formerly were; and thoſe Curtains never drawn, but at the time of Elevation; and the people were kept at ſuch a diſtance, as they could not onely not hear, but not ſee: what would you ſay to ſuch a reverence as that? And truly we are but children to thoſe Primitive Chriſtians, as well in devotion, as in time.</p>
                        <p>Now it would be worth your knowing like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, how the three principall Languages that were in our Saviours time were theſe three, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, Greek, and Latin, which is clearly by the Title affixt upon the Croſſe of Chriſt, that <hi>Pilate</hi> caus'd to be written in thoſe three Languages, que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionleſs not without a Myſterie: for as his Divine Majeſty was pleas'd, to ſuffer his name then to be glorifi'd by that Triumphall Title, in thoſe three Languages; ſo his Church hath ever ſince thought fit to glorifie it, and to perform divine offices
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:170406:28"/>principally in thoſe tongues: and therefore in our Maſs is retein'd the <hi>Hebrew Allellujah, Oſanna, Eya, Sabaoth, &amp;c.</hi> Then the Greek, <hi>Kyrie Eleyſon, Chriſte Eleyſon, Agios, Otheos, Yſkyros, Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos, Cleyſon, Emas;</hi> which words are as well now interpreted, and made known to the vulgar, as if they were words in their own Mother-tongues.</p>
                        <p>Then it wil be worth your while to take notice, that it is not in the power of any man to find out, that ever divine ſervice was celebrated in any part of the Weſtern Churches, but in Latine. For as we Weſtern Chriſtians receiv'd our Faith from <hi>Rome;</hi> ſo we have their Language ſtill in divine ſervice; and indeed ſo ſpeaking, <hi>Latine</hi> may be call'd our Mother-Tongue, for ſo it is of our faith; and what a confuſion would follow upon a change of Language in divine ſervice! how ſhould <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians, Spaniards, French, Dutch, Bohemians, Hungarians, &amp;c.</hi> Communicate with us, if our Maſſes were in <hi>Engliſh;</hi> all Chriſtian Nations would ſeem Barbarians one to another, and the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Maſs it ſelf, would fall into contempt: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as now all Nations, as if they were of one Pariſh, hear ſervice in the ſame Tongue every where; which may therefore, as I ſaid before, be truly call'd our Mother-tongue, becauſe it belongs to ſo many eminent Nations, and proves ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon benefit to: all you may pleaſe to adde, all this, to that upon reducing of the Maſs into vulgar Languages, there would not only follow a confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon divers Nations, but a terrible ſcandall in each particular people and Nation. For let us look no further, than our own little <hi>England</hi> here,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:170406:28"/>and examine the variety of Language in it, we ſhall find that ſome uſe the ſame word one way, and others another way, and the ſame word will ſignifie honeſtly and well, in one part of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and knaviſhly and vilely in another. Then we know that there is ſuch a diverſity in Tones and pronunciations amongſt us, betwixt <hi>North</hi> and <hi>South, Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt;</hi> that theſe ſacred myſteries, falling into ſuch vulgar mouths, that would not onely endanger to induce by their ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous diſſonancy, a <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> confuſion amongſt us, but likewiſe expoſe that moſt ſacred thing in Chriſtianity, to a contempt.</p>
                        <p>And yet after all theſe neceſſities and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences are conſidered, if you will remain obſtinate in your opinion, nor will otherwiſe be Catholick, but upon ſuch an account as this, that you may have our Maſs ſaid to you in <hi>Engliſh;</hi> I tel you again that I dare aſſure you, your whole Church may have it ſo; for I have been fairly inform'd, that it ha's been already proffer'd by the Pope, towards an accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation: for that, I am ſure he may for a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er good diſpence withall, it being but a pure point of diſcipline.</p>

Lukes</hi> Goſpel, is to be underſtood as the context ſhews, of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, that do what they are commanded onely to do, and that is but their duty, and no thanks are due to them; in like manner thoſe that keep the commandments of God, do but their duties: our Saviour ſays nothing, by your favour, of thoſe that obſerve the Evangelicall counſells, as the building of religious houſes, giving our goods among the poor, or morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of our bodies, which you ſeem to draw into the ſame concluſion. Beſides, as to the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:170406:35"/>keeping of the commandements, do you think, the meaning of that text is, that there is no merit at all due to that: it cannot poſſibly be ſo underſtood, muſt the caſe be the ſame, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him that does his duty well, and him that does it not at all, for ſo it muſt be as you ſeem to underſtand it; for at the worſt they can be but unprofitable, and at the beſt you would have them be ſo too; and this would not onely throw confuſion into all divinity, but would be the deſtruction of all civil government, and humane converſation. It is true what our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſays, <hi>when we have done all that is required of us, we are unprofitable ſervants,</hi> that is to him whom we ſerve, we are unprofitable, what does the Almighty and infinite creator, get by the ſalvation of his creature, nothing can be added to him. But the text tells us not, that in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we are unprofitable to our ſelves, God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid, for that would be to diſcourage all virtue, piety, and Chriſtianity it ſelf.</p>

                           <p>To what you alledge firſt out of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> I anſwer, that the Prophet there ſpeaks comparatively, between the righteouſneſs of the Law, and that of the Goſpel, for the legall purity compared to the Evangelicall, is impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity it ſelf, as our righteouſneſs compared to Gods, is no righteouſneſs, ſo our Saviour tells us,
<note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Luke</hi> 18. <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.17.</note> 
                              <hi>that none is good but one, that is God,</hi> becauſe our goodneſs compared to Gods goodneſs, is no goodneſs, is no goodneſs. To your next text I anſwer, that it onely infers, that there is none ſo righteous, but at ſometimes ſinnes, not that a man when he does well ſins. Then to what you alledge out of the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry plain, that the prophet <hi>David</hi> begs of God that he would not judge him, according to his
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:170406:36"/>own divine righteouſneſs, that is ſo abſolutely pure, and without ſin; for ſo, ſaith he,

                           <p>I grant indeed that Vows do reduce us into Bondage, but it is only to Chriſt, and ſuch a ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, is the nigheſt libercy. It is ſuch a ſervitude as the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, being freed from ſin ye are made the ſervants of Righteouſneſſe and to God, and to ſerve God is to Raign with him: from whence it is plain, that our obligation to pay our Vows, does in nothing repugne or Streighten our Chriſtian liberty, no more then our obligation to keep the Commandements does: and juſt ſo as the Tranſgreſſion of the Commandements throws us into the ſervitude of ſin; ſo does the breach, or not obſervance of our Vows. It is true, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelicall Counfells are at firſt free, but after a promiſe is once made, they become Obligatory; ſhall we make a conſcience to obſerve our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts with men and violate our Covenants with God? God forbid. The Lord commands us not to make Vows, but to pay and render them when they are made: as Matrimony before a Contract, is free, but when the Contract is once made, it is then firm and indiſſolveable, and therefore im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible (unleſſe in our Saviours caſe) to procure a Divorce. At firſt every man hath in his Free-Will to vow, or not to vow, but to pay the vow being once made, is ſo neceſſary, that a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:170406:66"/>recede from it, without hazard of his ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Our Saviour ſays, <hi>That no man ſetting his hand to the Plow, and looking back, is fit for the Kingdome of God. And again, Remember Lots Wife,

                           <p>I grant that it was indulg'd to the Prieſts and Levites in the Old Law to have Wives, becauſe they had a long time of vacancy from the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of their Miniſtry or Prieſthood. For there was a great multitude of them, and they ſerved by courſe; The caſe is not the ſame now, for our Prieſts are in dayly ſervice of the Altar, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be always ready, and without delay to attend their Miniſtry; ſo it would be very incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for them to be clog'd with Wives, beſides the indecency of it. Again they were to be only of one Tribe, the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> that were to bee taken into their Prieſthood, it was therefore ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the conſervation of the Tribe, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of the Prieſthood it ſelf, which otherwiſe in one age would have fayled that their Prieſts ſhould marry. Beſides we find that thoſe that were to ſacrifice in the Old Law, did abſtain ſomtime from their Wives likewiſe: ſo that St. <hi>Luke</hi> teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies of <hi>Zacharias, And then it came to paſs that ſo ſoon as the days of his Miniſtration were accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed,
<note place="margin">Luke 1.23.24.</note> he departed to his own houſe, and after thoſe days his Wife Elizabeth conceiv'd, &amp;c.</hi> Over and above all this the Prieſts of the Old Teſtament did handle but their propoſition bread, with the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:170406:67"/>fleſh of Goats, Oxen, Lambs and the like, but ours do dayly handle the precious body and blood of Chriſt.</p>
                           <p>As to the other part of your Argument, that the Greeks and other Chriſtians have a liberty for their Prieſts to marry. I ſay you are miſtaken, for no Prieſt amongſt them is permitted to marry, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he is a Prieſt, but one that has taken a Virgin to Wife, may be afterwards made a Prieſt, and if his Wife dye he muſt remain ſingle. So a marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man may be made a Prieſt, but no Prieſt can be made a married man:</p>

                           <p>That command of the Almighty which you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon, to increaſe and multiply, was given when the earth was to be repleniſh'd, &amp; heaven too for then then there were but few to procreate, now they are innumerable. Therefore that command is not to be taken amongſt thoſe permanent Laws, which were to oblige all Mankind, and every particular perſon, for then St. <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt had been a ſinner, who liv'd and dy'd a Virgin: Our bleſſed Lady had ſinned, who is the grand Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Virginity. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf had ſinned, who was the great Counſellour of Virginity: and out Saviour Chriſt had never commended Eunuchs for the Kingdome of Heaven. In like manner that precept, and repeated by our Saviour, <hi>Whom God hath joyned let no man ſeparate:</hi> concerns not ſure every one in the World, though it be given to every one multitude of, the World. So the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:170406:68"/>command concerning Tillage and Husbandry, does not make it neceſſary that all the World ſhould bee Husbandmen, though ſome muſt bee. Neither is it neceſſary for every individuall of mankind to imploy himſelf in procreation, though it is neceſſary that ſome muſt make it their buſineſſe to propagate. And ſo it is in an infinity of other things, that are neceſſary for a whole community, and yet not at all for every ſingle perſon; but it ſufficeth, that it be done by ſome.</p>

And the Hereticks which you ſpeak of,

Then that it is a great Sacrament in Chriſt and his Church, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle tells us, does it therefore follow that it is e're the leſs a Sacrament? on the contrary the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle here explains how it is a Sacrament, that is how it coms to be the ſign of a holy thing and that not of grace only, as all the others are, but of ſomething more, that is of the union between Chriſt and his Church: ſo upon the matter, it is ſo farre from being no Sacrament, that it may be well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted as a double one, with Reverence be it ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>

                        <p>We find in the <hi>Acts, That when the Apoſtles which were at Jeruſalem heard that Samaria had receiv'd the Word of God,

                        <p>Firſt it is very probable that the bleſſing which God Almighty gave to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, was not unaccompani'd with divine grace. But howſoever the inſtitution of our Saviour I'm ſure could not be without it:

                           <hi>Epheſians</hi> thus, <hi>Wives ſubmit your ſelves to your own Husbands, as unto the Lord, for the Husband is the head of the Wife, even as Chriſt is the head of the Church; and he is the Saviour of the body, therefore as the Church is ſubject to Christ,
<note place="margin">Epheſ 5.22, 23, 225</note> ſo let the Wives be to their own Husbands in every thing.

                        <p>We find in Saint <hi>Markes</hi> Goſpell, <hi>how our Saviour called unto him the twelve,

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:170406:74"/>them their miſſion fully, with orders how to behave themſelves, in their buſineſs, we find, that they went out accordingly, and Preached that men ſhould repent, and they caſt out many De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills: And then anointed with Oyle many that were ſick, and healed them. This it is not to be thought, that they did this upon their own heads, but by their Maſters command, by whoſe power they did thoſe mighty works, and having his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, ſure then none can deny but it was his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.</p>
                        <p>Then this Sacrament is ſo loudly proclaimed by Saint <hi>James,</hi> that I admire how any Chriſtian can believe in Scripture, and doubt the other. <hi>It any ſick among you,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle,
<note place="margin">James 5.14, 15.</note> 
                           <hi>let him call for the Elders of the Church, and let them pray o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him, anointing him with Oyle in the Name of the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> and if he have committed ſinns, they ſhall be forgiven him. Here is plainly a moſt viſible ſign, and as plainly, a moſt extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary grace accompanying it, that is to ſay, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins.</p>
                        <p>Thus you may clearly ſee, how extream Unction is a Sacrament of our Saviours own Inſtitution, or at leaſt plainly impli'd to have been inſtituted by him, and that by the action of the Twelve Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles before his face, whilſt he was upon earth, and at large declar'd to be ſo by the expreſs words of one of the Twelve that is Saint <hi>James.</hi> Over and above this, we have the univerſall tradition of the Church of Chriſt, that in theſe matters of faith, we know cannot erre: and that alone indeed might have been a ſufficient proofe of the verity
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:170406:75"/>of it, if our Saviour himſelf, his Apoſtles, and Evangeliſts had been ſilent in it. The truth is, that the Evangeliſts being to write in ſhort (for if they had writ at large, the whole world had not been able to contain the books that might have been written, as Saint <hi>John</hi> tells us) of the Acts, and words of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, made it their principall care to deliver punctually to us onely thoſe things that were moſt highly neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to our ſalvation; as we ſee how amply they have ſet down the Sacraments that were abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary, as Baptiſme, Pennance; and Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, and as for confirmition, and extream Uncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they do not ſo much as inſiſt upon, becauſe they are not of abſolute neceſſity to ſalvation, though they are very great expedients towards it; the one to confirm us in grace, after Baptiſm, the other to remove the reliques of ſin, after a hearty repentance. And it is the opinion of the learned in this point, that the benefit of this Sacrament, is ſuch, that a penitent with attrition onely recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this Sacrament, receives likewiſe ſuch a grace along with it, that by virtue of it, his ſins though mortall, may be forgiven him.

                     <head>My Lady upon the return of her ſervant, opening the Packet that Miſtreſs. <hi>N.</hi> had ſent back to her, found the Papers inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, whereof the firſt was to this effect as followeth.</head>
                     <p>That which your Church teacheth concerning the invocation of Saints, is a Doctrine very inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to God, and yet not more prophane then ſuperſtitious, and impertinent, and that I will prove thus.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Jeſus Chriſt our bleſſed Saviour, with God the Father, God the Holy Ghoſt, Holy Trinity in Unity, three Perſons and one God, alone is all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient, alone is moſt liberall, and alone is moſt mercifull, and who alone loves us more than all the Saints. There is not a Chriſtian living, that I think dares deny a word of this, if there ſhould be ſuch a monſter, a were eaſie to prove every word of it, by expreſs Scripture: who can think it rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall then to invoke any other thing; and beſides that, this all-bountifull, all-mercifull, all-power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, moſt good, moſt gracious, and moſt loving Lord God, has not onely enjoin'd us, but impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tun'd us to pray to him, and him alone, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to hear, and grant our requeſts, and that I prove by moſt expreſs Scriptures thus.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Firſt by the Goſpells it is moſt clear, our Saviour in Saint <hi>John</hi> aſſures it with a <hi>Verily, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, I ſay unto you, whatſoever ye ſhall ask the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:170406:76"/>Father in my name, he will give it you,
<note place="margin">John 16.23, 24.</note> and then in the next verſe, Ask, and ye ſhal receive,</hi> thus it is but asking of God and having, and yet you muſt think fit to go about by the Saints.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Then in Saint <hi>Lukes</hi> Goſpel we find, and I ſay unto you, <hi>ask and it ſhall be given you,
<note place="margin">Luke 11.9.10, 11, 12, 13.</note> ſeek and ye ſhall find, knock, and it ſhall be opened unto you. For every one that asketh receiveth, and he that ſeeketh findeth, and to him that knocketh it ſhall be opened.</hi> Then by the paralel of God with a good Father granting his childs requeſts he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes how much more ſhall your heavenly Father give the holy Spirit to them that ask him. Again, what you ask in prayet believing ye ſhall receive, as Saint <hi>Matthews</hi> Goſpell tells,
<note place="margin">Matth. 2.</note> with an infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of other places; too many to repeat to that purpoſe, wherefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> moſt pithily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes,
<note place="margin">Heb. 4.16.</note> 
                        <hi>Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of Grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help, in time of need.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4 The Apoſtle tells us,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1.3.</note> 
                        <hi>that God is the Father of mercies, and the Lord of all comforts, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we our ſelvs are comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God, &amp;c.</hi> If all our comfort then be from God, had we not better make our addreſs to him, that we know is the fountain of all Grace, than to the Saints, who can have nothing but what they derive from him.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The ſame Apoſtle tells <hi>Tymothy</hi> plainly that there is but one Mediatour between God and men, and that is Chriſt Jeſus; what an offence
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:170406:77"/>then muſt it needs be to God, to make more Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators, that is, the Saints? Then we finde fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in Scripture that he alone maketh inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſion for us, as in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> that he makes inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for tranſgreſſors:
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2.5. Iſai. 53.12. Rom. 8.26.24. Heb. 7.25.</note> and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that he ever liveth to make interceſſion for us. And again, who always maketh interceſſion for us, why ſhould we date to make more interceſſors, that is, the Saints.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. In fine to ſumme up all in ſhort, your Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of invocacion of the Saints, is highly injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to God, who is a jealous God, and will onely be worſhip'd. It is injurious to Jeſus Chriſt, who is the onely Mediatour between God and man. Thirdly it is injurious to our ſelves, for it is an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of a diffidence and diſtruſt in God, when we fly to the Saints for ſuccour: and then laſtly it is an impertinent and unprofitable piece of devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe the Saints in heaven neither do nor can hear our prayets, nor know our wants or what is done here amongſt us as <hi>Job</hi> tells us,
<note place="margin">Job. 24.21 Eccleſ. 9.5.</note> his ſons came to honor, and he knoweth it not, <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi> aſſures us, that the living know that they ſhall dye, but the dead know not any thing: and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> yet more plainly,
<note place="margin">Iſai. 63.16.</note> doubtleſsthou art our Father, though <hi>Abraham</hi> be ignorant of us, and <hi>Iſrael</hi> do not acknowledge us, &amp;c. Thus it is plain that the Saintf in heaven are incapable to know our wants, or hear our prayers, much leſs to help us.</p>

                        <p n="2">2. Again we find how good <hi>Hezekiah,
<note place="margin">2 King. 18.4.</note> removed the high places, and brake the Images, and brake in pieces the beazen Serpent that Moſes had made &amp;c.</hi> Yet your Religion ſtrives to reſtore to Chriſtians that kind of worſhip.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 How well our Saviour is pleaſed with that kinde of Worſhip,
<note place="margin">Joh. 22, 23 24.</note> you may ſee in Saint <hi>John</hi>'s Goſpell, where our Saviour ſays, <hi>ye worſhip, ye know not what, &amp;c. But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true Worſhippers ſhall worſhip the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Spirit and in Truth, for the Father ſeekes ſuch to worſhip him.

                        <p n="4">4 Over and above the danger of Idolatry, and many unclean thoughts, that may be occaſioned by Images, I ſhall onely add this one Argument, againſt ſo foul a thing, and that is this, either Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges are commanded, or commended for good meanes of divine worſhip, or they are not, if they be, then ſhew it by Scripture, if they be not, then it muſt follow, that it is a piece of will-worſhip, and that all Images, are meer fond and vain things.</p>

                        <p>And Firſt, as to your buſineſs of Indulgencies, I ſhall give but one blow, and that I preſume will be a mortall one, out of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi> where he ſaith, <hi>for I reckon. that the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of this preſent time,

                        <head>Then as to your Doctrine of Purgatory, I ſhall diſprove it thus.</head>
                        <p>The Prophet <hi>Daniell</hi> mentions but two ways for ſoules to go: The one <hi>to everlaſting life,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Dan. 11.2. Matth. 25.46.

                        <p>Again, the Scriptures plainly tells us, that thoſe which are to be ſaved, go immediately to Heaven, without any ſtop or ſtay by the way, therefore your Purgatory muſt needs be very much out of the way.
<note place="margin">Luk. 23.43.</note> As firſt we find in Saint <hi>Lukes</hi> goſpell, our Saviours own words to the Thief upon the Croſs. <hi>And Ieſus ſaid unto him Verily I ſay unto thee, to day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe:</hi> that is underſtood, immediately after his death, without any delay in Purgatory,
<note place="margin">Phil. 1.23.</note> or elſe where Then again St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Philipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> that he had a deſire to depart, and to be with Chriſt: therefore after departure, the ſaved ſoul goes immediately to Chriſt, without any rubbs, ſtops or ſtays by the way: what then is become of your pitifull purgatory? So I preſume I need not trouble your Ladyſhip with any more argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to convince ſo foul an errour. I ſhall only
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:170406:79"/>produce one or two more againſt your prayer for the dead, which is a conſequent of your Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and ſo conclude this Paper.</p>

It were enough for the ſatisfaction of any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable perſon in this point, to have diſproved purgatory, as I have done already, for if there be no Purgatory there can be no prayer for the dead uſefull at all, but I will proceed more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to prove againſt prayer for the dead thus, The Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> not only forbids to pray, but to weep for the dead, ſaying <hi>Weep ye not for the dead,
<note place="margin">Jer. 22.10.</note> neither bemoan him, but weep for him that goeth, aſtray, &amp;c.</hi> If the dead be not in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be wept for, they are mch leſſe in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be pray'd for; and by conſequence again, there can be no Purgatory.</p>

<note place="margin">Luk. 7.13.</note> Our Saviour again in like manner forbids the Widdow to weep for her Son that was dead; ſo ſtill it follows, if there ought to be no weeping, then no Purgatory, and if no Purgatory then no prayer for the dead.</p>

                           <p>To your firſt, ſecond, third, and fourth I ſhall anſwer together, and with good reaſon, for there runs the ſame fallacy along with them all; and I do wonder you ſhould be ſo deluded by the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſmes of your Doctors; for thoſe very Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that they have furniſhed you withall againſt us in this point, do as well take away the Interceſſion of Chriſt himſelf, and the prayers of the Saints living upon earth, as the interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Saints in heaven. For if this be a good conſequence, God is only to be worſhipt; therefore it is not lawfull to invoke the Saints in heaven, then this muſt be a good conſequence too, God is only to be worſhipped; therefore it is not lawfull to invoke or deſire the Saints on earth to pray for us: For this word only exclude; as well one as the other; and muſt of neceſſity, as well condemn the invocation of the Saints Militant, which all of you uſe, and the Apoſtle himſelf did too, as the invocation of the Saints Triumphant. Beſides we do acknowledge it to be our duty to pray and ask of God, and to pray and ask in <hi>Jeſus</hi> his name, and to pray and to ask with confidence, as the Apoſtle would have us, but nothing of all this can make an excluſion of the Saints. For by the Saints, as our fellow
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:170406:80"/>Members, we pray in the name of Jeſus our head; wherfore our Church always doth conclude its Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects of the Saints, <hi>with through Jeſus Chirſt our Lord;</hi> and you are to underſtand, that though God be moſt good, moſt gracious, and merciful, yet he is a God of order, and diſpoſeth of all things ſo ſweetly, that all Inferiours may lead us to Superiours, and ſo in this particular caſe, our Church is likewiſe well pleaſed, that we ſhould come boldly to the Throne of Grace, to the fountain of Grace, Father of Mercy, and God of all comforts; but this ſhe tels us, that we may more commodiouſly do it by the Saints, then only by our ſelves, who are moſt miſerable ſinners, and ſo muſt of neceſſity be abhorred by him: And the Scripture tels us, that our <hi>God is a conſuming fire;</hi> and we may juſtly fear leſt we periſh before his face, as wax melteth before the face of the fire,

The holy Spirit therefore would not by expreſs Scripture, teach this doctrine of veneration and invocation of Saints, but the Church being once eſtabliſht, quickly found by the Miracles and ſuccours, that thoſe Saints performed to men, that they were to be worſhipt, and invoked with prayers, that they would pleaſe to pray for us: and this is a worſhip far different from that, which we pay

Then as to your argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that you think is ſo ſtrange, and in your opinion caries horns with it, you will finde upon better examination, that they are but a pair of ears. You ſay either images are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, or they are not, if they be, then we are to ſhew it in Scripture, if they be not, then you ſay, it muſt follow, that it muſt be a will worſhip, or Idolatry.

It is enough to ſatisfie any reaſonable Chriſtian, that the Church hath appointed images to be ſet up, for the uſe of Chriſtians, as I ſay, for profitable, and almoſt neceſſary expedients to their devotion.

                              <hi>Mark</hi> 22</note> Carvers or Engravers in that age, is moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly falſe, for we finde our Saviour asking in the Goſpel, <hi>whoſe image and ſuperſcription is this?</hi> But all this I muſt paſs by, becauſe we have reſolved to inſiſt onely upon Scripture, and in the old Teſtament we finde enough.</p>
                        <p>Firſt we finde in <hi>Exodus,</hi> as a foreſaid,
<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Exod.</hi> 25.18.</note>

                              <hi>Numb.</hi> 21.8.</note> Then we finde the Lord ſaying to <hi>Moſes, make thee a fiery Serpent, and ſet it upon a Pole, and it ſhall come to paſs that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, be ſhall live, and Moſes did ſo, and it was a certain cure to them.</hi> Now this Brazen Serpent, was the figure or Type of Chriſt, hanging upon the Croſs, for as they that were bitten by the fiery Serpents, were cured by looking upon the Brazen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, ſo all they that are bitten by the devil, are cured by a faithful looking upon Jeſus Chriſt Crucified, as we finde in the Goſpel of <hi>S. John,</hi> from whence I think I may conclude. The figure muſt of neceſſity be of leſs value than the thing that is figured. as <hi>Moſes</hi> who was likewiſe the figure of Chriſt, was of much leſs value then Chriſt himſelf, the Paſchal Lamb
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:170406:87"/>leſs to be eſteemed then our Euchariſt, and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion than Baptiſm. If then the image of the Brazen Serpent was honour'd, as we know it was, how much more ought the image of Chriſt be honoured? nay it is plain that the Serpent had not been honoured at all, but as it was the figure or ſhadow of the image of Chriſt upon the Croſs, nor had it cured thoſe that were bitten by the fiery Serpents, but by the virtue of Chriſt, who cures ſtill all that are bitten by the devil. As to the breaking of it by <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> I have hinted already, that the end for which it was made ceaſed, it was of no uſe longer then the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were in the wildernes, for there was no more danger of Serpents in the land of promiſe. But the image of Chriſt Crucified is made to this end, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent to us our bleeding Saviour, and to call to minde thoſe benefits that we receive by that his bitter death and paſſion, now this end, muſt laſt till the end of the world, therefore his image is ſtill to be retained, and kept with honour for ever.
<note place="margin">2 <hi>King.</hi> 8</note> Beſides the brazen Serpent, after the end of its making ceaſed, began to be as a foreſaid an occaſion of Idolatry, which the image of Chriſt cannot be amongſt us Chriſtians, for we know it is ſet up to no other intent of purpoſe, then to repreſent our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and his benefits to us.</p>

<note place="margin">1 <hi>Kings</hi> 7</note> would <hi>Solomon</hi> have done it?

                        <p>In the like manner we finde in the <hi>Revelation</hi> of S.
<note place="margin">

<note place="margin">2 <hi>Mach.</hi> 15. <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. <hi>Mark</hi> 9. <hi>Luke</hi> 9.24.</note> a great evidence of the truth of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, and a convincing one indeed, may be taken from the frequent apparitions of many departed ſouls, to paſs by thoſe in the <hi>Machabees</hi> of <hi>Onias</hi> and <hi>Hieremias</hi> that appeared to <hi>Judas,</hi> we finde that <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to Chriſt when he was transfigured, and the diſciples themſelves, after the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Saviour, when he appeared to them thought that they had ſeen a ſpirit, which they would never have thought, unleſs they had known that the ſpirits of ſome departed, did make uſual apparitions, now granting ſuch a thing, as the apparition of a ſpirit, which I take to be already proved, it muſt follow that thoſe ſouls muſt be repoſed in ſome place that is not in heaven, for then they would never wander here to ſo great a loſs, nor can they be in hell, from whence there is no redemption.</p>
                        <p>Again, we finde the Theif upon the Croſs ſaying to our Saviour, <hi>Lord remember me, when thou comeſt into thy kingdom,</hi> which he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaid, but that he thought that Jeſus Chriſt had a power to pardon ſins after this Life. S. <hi>Paul</hi> likewiſe was certainly of this opinion, where he tells the <hi>Corrinthians</hi> thus, <hi>elſe what ſhall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead riſe not at all, why are they then
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:170406:93"/>baptized for the dead?</hi> which plainly ſhews that it was a practiſed courſe amongſt the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans then to undertake duties and voluntary af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions in the behalf of the dead; which ſure was imagined to be for their advantage, and yet you think much to pray for them.</p>
                        <p>Now the reaſon of all this is very cleer, for we know that a man who ſins mortally, may have the mortality of that ſin forgiven him, and conſequently be freed from the guilt of eternal puniſhment, and yet may be obnoxious to ſome temporal penalties, which if he does not ſatisfie in this life, he muſt expect to do it in the next. As for example, we ſee a King does often pardon an offender his life, which he has forfeited to the Law, and deſerved to looſe, and yet he may inflict baniſhment, or impriſonment, upon the ſame perſon, and this very courſe we finde taken by God in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.
<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Num.</hi> 20 12. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.48. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.13, 14. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.10.</note> Firſt we ſee the ſin of unbelief forgiven by God, to <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> that is as to the eternal puniſhment, and yet they were puniſht with a temporal death. Again we finde King <hi>David,</hi> after he had obtained a pardon for his fins of Adultery and Murder, was puniſht yet with the death of his ſon, nay after the prophet <hi>Nathan</hi> had declared, that the Lord had put away his ſin, he ſhould not dye yet his ſon muſt, and again the ſame King <hi>David</hi> for his ſin of pride in numbring the people, was pardoned, as to the eternal guilt, and yet we ſee what a temporal puniſhment followed upon it; and he was forced to chooſe one of the three
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:170406:93"/>Plagues for it. <hi>I</hi> might be infinite in examples of the like kinde, but I have ſomething elſe to ſay to this point, ſo muſt not inſiſt too long in that particular of it. We know again, that a righteous man may ſometimes happen to dye with a great many venial ſins about him, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if he be prevented with any ſudden death ſo cannot poſſibly have time enough to bethink himſelf, much leſs to repent of them, ſo muſt ſtill remain obnoxious to the temporal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that is due to thoſe ſins, certainly in ſuch a caſe, that perſon cannot be admitted into the joyes and glory of heaven, till he be freed from thoſe venial ſins, and the guilt of that temporal puniſhment that is due for them. So we finde in the <hi>Revelation, that there ſhall in no wiſe enter into it,
<note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.27.</note> any thing that defileth neither whatſoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lye &amp;c.</hi> now ſuch a perſon is poſſible to be, and we may very well ſuppoſe it, that he cannot be freed in this life, therefore after it, it muſt be: nor can this be in Heaven, or in Hell, therefore it muſt be in Purgatory.</p>
                        <p>Over and above all this, the undeniable practiſe of the Church in praying for the dead is a moſt invincible argument for Purgatory, and no man can deny, but that cuſtome is much ancienter than Chriſtianity, and has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ever ſince That it was ancienter then Chriſtianity, we finde in the <hi>Machabees,</hi> which book though you ſhut out of the Cannon of holy Scripture, (with as much reaſon as you
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:170406:94"/>do other things) yet you allow it more credit than any ordinary Author,
<note place="margin">2 <hi>Mach.</hi> 12.43, 44, 45.</note> how then ſhould it fail ſo groſſy as to make a lye in matter of fact as well as matter of faith. We are told there of a ſacrifice offered for the dead, and that he ſent two thouſand Drachmes of ſilver to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> to offer a ſin-offering, doing therein very well and honeſtly, in that he was mindeful of the reſurrection: for if he had not hoped that they that were ſlain, ſhould have riſen again, it had been ſuperfluous and vain to pray for the dead, and alſo in that he perceived that there was a great favour laid up for thoſe that dyed godly (it was a holy and good thought whereupon he made a reconciliation for the dead, and that they might be delivered from ſin.
<note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.16, 18.</note> But if you will deny the authority of this book, you will not ſure deny that of <hi>S. Paul,</hi> who prays for the whole houſehold of <hi>Oneſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorus,</hi> ſome whereof were dead in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and <hi>Oneſiphous</hi> himſelf dead in hiſtory, before the writing of that Epiſtle, wherefore he prays to the Lord to give mercy unto them and that <hi>Oneſiphorus</hi> himſelf may finde mercy of the Lord, in that day; it is plain from hence, that there is a capacity for mercy at the laſtday by conſequence therefore there muſt be a third place, that is nesther Heaven nor Hell, and ſo by conſequence again, prayer for the dead muſt be a a very good devotion, and available to the caſe, and releaſe of thoſe poor ſouls. And to this truly, if all Scripture were perfectly ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, the practiſe of the Church of Chriſt has
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:170406:94"/>been cleer and univerſal, that no prudent Chriſtian can deny his aſſent, if he be not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to ſhake the very foundations of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity it ſelf. <hi>which the gates of bell, ſhall never prevail againſt.</hi>

                        <p n="3">3 We finde in the Goſpells,
<note place="margin">Math.

                        <p>The firſt not of Antichriſt is that he muſt fall away from the faith,

                           <note place="margin">1 John 2.23.</note> Then a fifth mark we have of him out of St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> that he muſt deny Jeſus Chriſt.

The ſixth mark we have again that he is a Lyar and a worker of falſe miracles, and that we ſee your Pope to do ſtill at <hi>Lorettoy</hi> and other places.

                           <p>I anſwer, that the Apoſtle there in that Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the <hi>Romans</hi> ſpeaks of Chriſt only, as he is head of the Church, by the internal influencies of his gifts of grace; and ſo it is true, that all the faithfull are fellow members, as well Saint <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf, and the Pope too, as any other Chriſtians; nor in this ſenſe can the Pope be thought to be head at all, for all are to receive grace from Chriſt the head, not from Saint <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> or the Pope. But if you ſpeak of Chriſt, as he is head of the Churrh, by his eternal Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of it, then not only he himſelf, but <hi>Peter</hi> alſo is the head; for though to him Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily and in his proper power, the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment belongeth, ſo ſecondarily it belongs to the other, and by a power derived from him. And whereas I know here you will be ready to reply, that the Church has two heads, which is monſtrous, I anſwer, that a Kingdom is not to be ſaid to have two heads, when the King is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and a Vice-king preſent with it; for one is ſubordinate to another: ſo the Church may
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:170406:101"/>have two heads, one primary, and the other ſecondary as aforeſaid. Ile give you another ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample out of the Apoſtle, who tels us, that the <hi>man is the head of the woman,</hi> yet the woman has another head, that is her natural one, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fides her husband; ſhall we therefore ſay, that every married woman is a Monſter with two heads.</p>

                           <p>I anſwer as before, that a head is taken two ways in relation to the Members, firſt according to the internal influence which proceeds from the head, into the other members, and ſo there can be but one head of one body. Secondly, as to the external Government, ſo there may be two heads of one body; ſo the body of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man as aforeſaid, has but one head, from which it receives the influence of ſenſitive ſpirits, but has two as to the Government of her external actions: for in the one ſhe is govern'd by her own natural head, and in the other by her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, who is her moral head. It is juſt ſo in the Church, which has but one head as to the influx of grac, but two as to its Government, whereof one ſupplies the place of the other the firſt was only Chriſt is head, and all others are members; the laſt way not only Chriſt, but <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> is head, who the former way is ſo far from being a head, that he is but a common member. When therefore the Apoſtle tels the <hi>Corinthiaus</hi> that Chriſt and his Church make but up one en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:170406:101"/>myſtical body, which conſiſt of head, and members, this muſt be underſtood in the former ſence; for the Apoſtle ſpeaks plainly there of Chriſt, as he is head of the Church by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal diviſion of his gifts, of grace, as is plain by the context, and ſo in that caſe it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, but all beſides Chriſt are Members of the Church, and none beſides him can be head of it. But if you ſpeak as to the external Gouernment, then Chriſts Vicar may be head, and all others Members, as in Kingdoms Govern'd by a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty or Vice-king, as aforeſaid.</p>

                           <p>I freely grant what you urge out of the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpels,</hi> that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> did commend the care of his Church to all his Apoſtles, but I deny that he commanded it equally to all; for only to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> he ſaid, <hi>Feed my ſheep,</hi> therefore the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Paſtorſhip was only committed to <hi>Peter,</hi> and to none of the reſt. Nor do I underſtand any force in that argument of yours, which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows thus: All of them were equally taught and inſtructed by Chriſt, and all of them received the holy Ghoſt equally; therefore one had no more juriſdiction then another. For it is one thing to ſpeak of the Learning and Sanctity of the Apoſtles, and another to ſpeak of their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer or juriſdiction. It is not neceſſary that all which have equality of one, ſhould have equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the other. Otherwiſe a King in his Kingdom, if he had not more learning and
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:170406:102"/>holineſs than his Subjects, ſhould not have a greater power and authority, which you know, how abſurd it is to ſay: and the reaſon is plain, for power and juriſdiction do not neceſſarily, and of themſelves depend upon Learning and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity; and ſuppoſe we grant that all the Apoſtles were equal, before <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaid to <hi>Peter, Feed my ſheep,</hi> it does not follow that they were all equal afterwards but that <hi>Peter</hi> had ever after that his juſt preheminence.</p>

                           <p>I grant that <hi>Paul</hi> did reſiſt <hi>Peter,</hi> and juſtly, for <hi>Peter</hi> was in an errour, and yet not in any Article of faith neither, for in that he could not err; for <hi>Chriſt</hi> aſſured him that he had askt his Father, that his Faith ſhould not fail; but his errour was in matter of Fact only, becauſe he did unadviſedly diſſemble Judaiſm to the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall and offence of the Gentiles; but from hence it follows not that <hi>Peter</hi> was not the head of the Church, no more then this is a conſequence, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> was rebuked by <hi>Joah;</hi> therefore <hi>David</hi> was not the Head of his Kingdom.

For Chriſt gave the power of the Keys to his Church in the perſon of St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi> ſo St. <hi>Peter</hi> had the power of the keys, as he bore the perſon of the Church onely.

                           <p>I anſwer thus, that it was no wonder, that our Saviour rebuk'd <hi>Peter,</hi> for reſiſting the ſence that he propos'd to him, concerning his being put to death, becauſe he had not yet receiv'd the Keys, he was not yet confirm'd, nor was yet the fulneſſe of the ſpirit yet come upon him. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was not yet the Rock, but Chriſt after his Reſurrection, fullfill'd that promiſe to him and founded his Church upon him. Then very learn'd men are of opinion are of opinion that Jeſus Chriſt ſaid to thoſe words to <hi>Peter,</hi> but to the Divell himſelf, who was the Suggeſtor of that miſtake to him. Again, the fall of a perſon, in point of opinion, does not neceſſity take away his power. Then again <hi>Peter</hi> not being yet fully confirm'd, it is poſſible that he might have a Revellation from God the Father, by which he might profeſs Chriſt to be the Son of the living God, and yet that great myſtery might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd from him, as yet that Chriſt would be cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifi'd for the ſalvation of mankind, and riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the third day: and becauſe you are pleas'd to put the Divell upon us for our Head, I
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:170406:104"/>would ask you, what was the Rock our Saviour meant? if faith, as you pretend, then I ſay Faith is ſo ſoon loſt in a man as grace, and the faith of one man muſt be as conſiderable to that founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the faith of any other man; and ſo upon the faith of all the faithfull, the Church is to bee built, and if all the faithfull are to be the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; what kind of Church, will you leave to Chriſtianity?</p>

                           <p>I anſwer, that your argument is not good at all, <hi>Peter</hi> was ſent by the Apoſtles into <hi>Samaria,</hi> therefore he was leſs then the other Apoſtles:
<note place="margin">Joh. 6.20.

                           <p>It is plain that Chriſt did only prohibit am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and Tyrannie amongſt his Apoſtles, not power and order, becauſe they are of God, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> tels us,

                           <p>Again we find how clearly the Primacy of St. <hi>Peter</hi> may be proved out of St. <hi>Lukes</hi> Goſpell; When our Saviour twice repeats his name.
<note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.31, 32.</note> 
                              <hi>And the Lord ſaid, Simon, Simon, behold Satan hath deſired to have you, that he may ſift you as Wheat, but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not; and when thou art converted ſtrengthen thy brethren.</hi> Obſerve I pray you how our Saviour prays for him moſt particularly and above the reſt, and he askt two things for him, Firſt, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defectibility of his faith, and then a power to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the reſt of the Apoſtles and all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall.</p>
                           <p>Again, we find in St. <hi>Matthews</hi> Goſpell, how Chriſt before all his Apoſtles ſaith to <hi>Peter, Go thou to the red Sea,
<note place="margin">Math. 17.27.</note> and caſt an book and take up the Fiſh that firſt cometh up, and when thou haſt opened his mouth, thou ſhalt find a piece of money that take, and give unto them for me and thee.</hi>
                              <pb n="204" facs="tcp:170406:106"/>here it is plain that though the reſt of his Diſciples were preſent, he paid only for him, and made him equall to himſelf in the payment.</p>
                           <p>We find in all the Goſpells, where there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny deſcription of the conſtitution of the Apoſtles or any mention made of them;
<note place="margin">Math. 10.</note> 
                              <hi>Peter</hi> is ſtill no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated firſt,
<note place="margin">Mark. 3.</note> as the head of all the reſt, which would not have been done but in regard of his Primacy,
<note place="margin">Luke 6</note> and ſo it has been ever underſtood by the Church. Then we find that though all the Apoſtles were preſent at our Saviours appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the Sea Coaſt,
<note place="margin">Joh. 21.7.</note> onely <hi>Peter</hi> did come upon the water of the Sea to him,
<note place="margin">Luke 5.4.</note> which was no doubt a ſign of his ſingular power and prerogative above the reſt. In like manner though all the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples were commanded to looſe their Nets, onely <hi>Peter</hi> was commanded to Launch into the deep.</p>
                           <p>But above all, we find the performance of that long promis'd Primacy, made to St. <hi>Peter</hi> moſt expreſly in St. <hi>Johns</hi> Goſpell. <hi>Jeſus ſaith to Simon Peter,

<pb n="205" facs="tcp:170406:106"/>things, thou knoweſt that I love thee, Jeſus ſaith unto him, feed my ſheep.</hi> Here it was that <hi>Peter</hi> receiv'd his paſtorall charge, which was but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed him before: and in the preſence of all the Apoſtles the care of Chriſts ſheep was committed to him as to the Prince of the Apoſtles. Now to Feed,
<note place="margin">Ezek. 34. Iſai. 44.56. Jerem 26.22. Pſalm 32.</note> in Scripture is very frequently taken in Scripture, for to govern, &amp; Rule, &amp; Paſtors likewiſe for Kings, as may be ſeen throughout the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. But that I may contract my ſelf in this Copious Theam: I ſhall endeavour to ſumme up all the Prerogatives of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> that are given him in Scripture, and then leav your ſelf to judge whether he was not intended by our Saviour to be Primate and Superiour.</p>
                           <p>Firſt, it is manifeſt that he alone of all the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles had the honour to have his Proper-name changed, and a new one given him by Chriſt. Secondly in the Repetition of all their Names, <hi>Peter</hi> is always put firſt. Thirdly, the Scripture always ſpeaks of <hi>Peter</hi> as a Prince, and of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers as Subjects. Fourthly, <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks in the Name of all the reſt, as the chief amongſt them. Fifthly, onely to <hi>Peter</hi> was the firſt Revellation made of the Divinity of Chriſt. Sixthly, onely to <hi>Peter</hi> was made a promiſe of the infallability of his faith, and ſtability of his chair. Seventhly, Chriſt paid Tribute only for himſelf and <hi>Peter,</hi> and for none of the reſt, and as much for <hi>Peter</hi> as himſelf. Eightly, Jeſus Chriſt after his Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, made his firſt Apparition to <hi>Peter</hi> alone of all the Apoſtles; and all this you cannot deny to be perfect Goſpell Now you may pleaſe to
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:170406:107"/>take notice of theſe Eight Priviledges or Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives ſpoken of in the Goſpell, were before he was actually inſtated in his Primacy, for that was not till after our Saviours Reſurrection, ſo theſe that I have already mentioned, were but as ſignes or previous diſpoſitions to his future Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy and power, which how he afterwards execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, you ſhall ſee in theſe particular prerogatives more. Firſt to <hi>Peter</hi> alone it was abſolutely ſaid, <hi>Feed my ſheep,</hi> there was his power confer'd and confirm'd upon him. Secondly Peter by his own Authority call'd all the reſt of the Apoſtles to the election of a new Apoſtle in the place of the Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor <hi>Judas,</hi> and directed the Ordination of <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thias</hi> into that Apoſtleſhip;

And Peter ſtood up in the midſt of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and ſaid men and buethren, &amp;c.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Peter</hi> only in the day of Penticoſt, defended all the reſt of the Apoſtles when they were ſaid to be full of Wine: for the Text tells us, that <hi>Peter</hi> ſtanding up with the Eleven did lift up his voyce and ſaid unto them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Acts 2.</note> when he pronouncedſentence of death upon <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias</hi> and <hi>Saphira.</hi> Seventhly, <hi>Peter</hi> was the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſon that proceeded to juſtice againſt <hi>Simon Magus</hi> for his wicked marketting of the Holy-Ghoſt. 8ly, he was the firſt that did publickly did preach the Goſpel to the Jews, after thedeſcent of the Holy ghoſt. 9ly, He was the firſt that did like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe preach the Goſpel to the Gentiles, &amp; to whom only the heavenly Viſions offered for the calling of the Gentiles,
<note place="margin">Act. 10.12, 13.</note> and by which he was comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to take a particular care of them as his own cure, and as their proper Prelate: When he ſaw the great Sheet let down to the Earth, wherein were allmanner of fore-footed beaſts, and creeping things of the Earth, &amp;c.

Here are plainly Ten parts or pieces of his paſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall prerogative that he exerciſed after the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of our Saviour, when he was eſtabliſht in his paſtorall charge by thoſe Words, <hi>Feed my Sheep.</hi> And if all the ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           <pb n="208" facs="tcp:170406:108"/>
                           <p>And yet truly if that Scripture had not been ſo punctually plain in this particular, as we ſee it is for St. <hi>Peter</hi> and his Succeſſors, the very Analogy of reaſon would induce, that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould appoint ſomebody for that great charge to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern his whole Church. Firſt let us look upon the Anology of the Chriſtian Church, and that of the Jews. The Moſaicall ſynagogue was but a Type or ſhadow of the Church of Chriſt but the Synagogue was always govern'd by one viſible head, Namely the High Prieſt, to whom all others were ſubject, as is apparent out of the Books of <hi>Exod. Levit. Deut.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Therefore the Church of Chriſt ought to be ſo governed. For it is not fit that the more perfect government, which by all is acknowledg'd to be Monarchy, ſhould be over the ſhadow (that we know is more imperfect then the ſubſtance) and and not over the ſubſtance it ſelf which is the Church of Chriſt. And as the Jewiſh Synagogue was the Type of our Church, ſo undoubtedly their High Prieſts were the Types of our Popes: and as they preſided over the whole Jewiſh Nation as to the externall government, ſo our Popes in like manner, do over all Chriſtian peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
                           <p>Now I ask you how it can ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                                 <desc>••</desc>

<pb n="209" facs="tcp:170406:108"/>which are his own words, and that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould neglect to provide in the ſame manner, for his own beloved Spouſe, his Church?

<note place="margin">Deut. 18.9. 1 Kings 22 7.</note> which did expreſly prohibit all that, and partly to the Teſtimony of the Prophets, who were appointed by God to foretell futurities to them. The ſenſe therefore of thoſe words, to the Law and to the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
<note place="margin">1 Sam. 28.7.</note> is this: if you will be inform'd of future events, you ought not to conſult witches, wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards, or ſorcerers, as <hi>Saul</hi> did, becauſe God had forbidden that by his Law, to which I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore remitted you, but conſult ye the Prophets of God, whoſe office it is, to foretell all future things that ye ought to know. What does this make to the deriſion of difficult controverſies, or determination of matters of Faith? Nothing at all ſure, unleſs you can think this Argument to
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:170406:109"/>be good. It is not Lawful to conſult Witches, Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards and Sorecters, therefore onely Scripture is to be the Judge of controverſies. This ſure is a very pitifull Argument, and yet ſuch as that, do your great Rabbins, and principall Doctors make uſe of, to abuſe you and themſelves.</p>

                           <p>I grant, that Jeſus Chriſt diſputing with the Jews, who denyd him to be the Son of God does remit them to the Scriptures, but not to them on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neither, for he proves himſelf to be ſo by other Teſtimonies.

                           <p>I ſay that your Argument, if it had any weight at all, would ſerve altogether as well agianſt your ſelf as us, for if as you underſtand it every man be a Lyar add may erre, it will follow neceſſarily, that <hi>Moſes</hi> with the Prophets, Apoſtles and Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, nay that your Friends, <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> nay all your Preachers to be Lyars and may erre, becauſe they are men, therefore there is no cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to be given to any of them, no confidence to be put in them, but all things that are ſaid by them muſt be taken for ſuſpected and uncertain: where then is faith? Nor matters it though they ſay, that the Word which they tell us, is not their own but Gods Word, for if they be Lyars, they may as well lye in the delivery of Gods meſſage, as in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing elſe of their own, nothing therefore can be certain. But God forbid that any Chriſtian ſhould think ſo, for it is far otherwiſe.</p>
                           <p>Firſt, we confeſſe the Scripture to be certain and infallible, becauſe it is the Word of God, but we adde that it is ſo obſcure, that the true ſence and meaning cannot eaſily appear to every man: Therefore of neceſſity there muſt be ſome other Judge that muſt infallibly determine what
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:170406:111"/>is the clear and genuine ſence of the Scripture it ſelf. Now this infallible Judge cannot poſſibly be every private man, for then there would be ſo many Judges as there be men, and diverſities of Opinions: and ſo there would be an utter impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility to agree to any thing, or compoſe any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in Religion, every one being apt to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour his own opinion.

<pb n="216" facs="tcp:170406:112"/>as it were the heart of it, ſo long therefore as the faithfull Chriſtian ſhall continue in the unity of the Church and keep cloſe to the Doctrine of the ſupream Biſhop and Councells, he ſhall partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate of the aſſiſtance and government of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, nor can erre in faith: but if through any pride or perverſity of ſpirit, he ſhall diſagree and depart from that head and heart, then he ſhuts all thoſe paſſages and Chanels, by which that divine aſſiſtency and direction is to be derived, and ſo muſt of neceſſity be ſeduced from truth, and led into a Labyrinth of errours, as we have ſadly ſeen in all the antient and modern Hereticks. The next ſimilitude may be drawn from a flock of ſheep which indeed is the beſt repreſentation of the Church,
<note place="margin">Ioh. 10.14 math. 28.20.</note> as our Saviour himſelf is pleas'd to atteſt in the Goſpel: for as the whole flock being in one Fold or place collected together, has the perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all aſſiſtance and guard of the Shepherd, and ſo are defended from the malice &amp; fierceneſs of wolves ſo the Univerſall Church of the faithfull, being collected in one faith and ſpirit. has the perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all care and aſſiſtance of that divine Shepherd, who ſaid, <hi>I an the good Shepherd, and know my Sheep,</hi> and again, <hi>and I am always with you to the end of the World.</hi> And juſt as each ſingle Sheep ſo long as it remains in the ſociety and Communion with the Flock, and under the aare and cuſtody of the Shepherd, is ſafe and ſecure from the mouths of wolves, ſo is each ſingle Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, ſo long as he remains joyned and tyed up in the unity of the Church, that is, ſubmits to the ſence and doctrine of the whole Church, is
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:170406:112"/>never err'd yet in matter of faith, nor ever can, now I preſume you may require to know of me whether all and every one of this Church hath this great aſſiſtance and direction of the Holy Spirit; that he cannot erre in matter of Faith?</p>
                           <p>I do readily anſwer, that every one of the faithfull has it, but by way of dependance upon the Church, and from it. So long therefore as any man remains in conjunction with the Church he cannot erre; if he ſeparates or diſſents from it, he muſt needs of neceſſity fall into an errour, which I'le thus explain to you, by two Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples or ſimilitudes.</p>
                           <p>The one may be taken from the proportion of a humane body, in which we ſee that all the members do jointly and ſeverally paticipate of the vitall and ſenſitive ſpirits, by which life is preſerved in them all, but yet they have theſe ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits derivatively from, and by way of dependen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy upon the head and heart: for it is from them as from a double Fountain, thoſe ſpirits are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived into the other members: ſo that when the Channells and paſſages, by which that deriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and diſtribution is made, are ſtopt or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted, it muſt follow neceſſarily, that the other Members muſt be left deſtitute of ſpirits, and be rendred incapable of performing their Office, but being open all will be well. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in the Church, all the faithfull, which are as it were Members of it, have a certain aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy and direction from the holy Ghoſt, but by way of dependency upon the Pope, who is as the head of the Church and from Councils, which are
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:170406:113"/>ſafe and ſecure from all danger of errour and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity. In the laſt place, as ſheep that go aſtray from the flock, are out of the protection of the Shepherd, and by conſequence muſt fall into the danger of Wolves: ſo Chriſtians which depart from the common ſence and doctrine of the Church muſt of neceſſity fall into millions of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, for want of the aſſiſtance of the holy ſpirit, which is the Judge and Guardian of that. I pray you good Miſtriſs <hi>N.</hi> have a care how you expoſe your ſelf to this terrible danger.</p>

                        <head>To what you alledge for Scripture to be the only Rule of our faith, and againſt the Authority of the univerſall Church and it's Traditions, <hi>I anſwer thus.</hi>

                           <p>I ſay that you are very much miſtaken in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Scripture, ſo I ſhall be bold to inlarge a little upon it, for your better underſtanding. And firſt it is to be obſerved that our Saviour himſelf writ no book at all, neither commanded his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples or Apoſtles to write any, inſo much as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſend them to plant his Church,
<note place="margin">Matth. 28.</note> he ſaid not to them go and write, <hi>but go and preach to the whole World.</hi> Therefore we find the Old Law written in Tables of Stone: but the Goſpell had no other writing then, but in the hearts of Chriſtians. So St. <hi>Paul</hi> plainly expreſſeth it, <hi>Ye are our Epiſtle &amp;c.</hi> &amp; again,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.2, 3.</note> 
                              <hi>Foraſmuch as ye are manifeſtly declard to be the Epiſtle of Chriſt, miniſtred by us, not with ink, but with the ſpirit of the living God, not in Tables of ſtone, but in fleſhly tables of the heart, &amp;c.</hi> This was before propheſyed by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Jerem. Behold the days come,
<note place="margin">Jer. 31.31.302 3,</note> ſaith the Lord, that I will make a new Cavenant with the Houſe Iſraell and with the Houſe of Judah, not according to the Covenant that I made with their Fathers.</hi> But this ſhall be the Covenant that I will make with the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael, after thoſe days, ſaith the Lord, I wil put my Law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts, and I wil be their God and they ſhall be my people, &amp;c.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <pb n="224" facs="tcp:170406:116"/>
                           <p>Again we find, that the Church is much an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cienter then Scripture; for when the Apoſtles began to preach, there was no Evangelical Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, no Epiſtle of St. <hi>Paul</hi> extant, and yet the Church was then purchaſed and sprinkled with the blood of Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Acts 1.</note> and governed by his unerring Spirit. So the Apoſtles without any authority of the Scripture of the New-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, proceeded to the election of <hi>Matthias,</hi> and to the ordination or ſeven Deacons,
<note place="margin">Acts 5.6.</note> 
                              <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So <hi>Peter</hi> proceeded to the ſentence againſt <hi>Anani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> which ſtruck the breath out of their bodies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now we know that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles were very diligent in preaching, and ſowing the word of God; and yet we finde but very little that they left us in writing; ſo it muſt follow, that they taught a great deal more then they wrote, which muſt have equal authority with their writings. Yet further, it is plain that the Scripture it ſelf cannot be authentical, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the authority of the Church; for the Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Writers themſelves, were but members of the Church; and how ſhall any private man know what Scripture is Canonical and what not, but by the Church?
<note place="margin">John 3.</note> Why ſhould any man believe the Goſpel of St. <hi>Mark</hi> to be Canonical, who never ſaw Chriſt, and the Goſpel of <hi>Nicodemus</hi> not to be ſo, who both ſaw and heard Chriſt, as St. <hi>John</hi> teſtifies of him? and why ſhould the Goſpel of St. <hi>Luke</hi> the Diſciple be receiv'd, and the Goſpel of St. <hi>Bartholomew</hi> the Apoſtle be rejected, unleſs we humbly comply with the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and authority of the Church, which hath ſo
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:170406:116"/>ordered it, and clearly confeſs that the Church can judge of Scriptures? Thus ſince it is plain, that the Church is ancienter then Scripture, and that no Scripture can be thought authentical, without the authority of the Church,
<note place="margin">Exod. 20.</note> can any Chriſtian be blamed, for ſaying that he would never believe the Scripture, but that the Authority of the Church commanded? it over over and above all this the Authority of the Church over Scripture is hugely evident in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny particulars of Scripture: As firſt,
<note place="margin">Matth. 28. Act. 15.</note> the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture commands thus, <hi>Remember that thou keep holy the Sabbath day, ſix days ſhalt thou labour, and do all that thou haſt to do, but the ſeventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God,</hi> &amp;c. And yet the Church changed the Sabbath into the Lords day by its own authority,
<note place="margin">Matth. 28.19, 20.</note> and not only without, but againſt known Scripture. Again, Chriſt ſaid to his Diſciples in the Mount, <hi>that he came not to diſſolve the Law, but fulfill it;</hi> and yet the Church in the Apoſtles Councel, decreed and pronounced boldly for the Ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe Legalities. We find again in the laſt of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> Chriſt ſaying to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>Go ye therefore, and teach all Nations, bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt, teaching them to obſerve all things, whatſoever I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded you.</hi> Here Chriſt laid down an expreſs form of Baptiſm in the name of the holy Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and yet the primitive Church did think fit to change that form into a Baptiſm in the name of Jeſus Chriſt only, for ſo St. <hi>Peter</hi> enjoyned
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:170406:117"/>them, <hi>Repent and be baptized every one of you, in the name of Jeſus Chriſt, for the remiſſion of ſins,</hi> &amp;c. And again we finde that the <hi>Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars</hi> were baptized by St. <hi>Philip</hi> in the name of <hi>Jeſus:</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Act. 2.38. Acts 8. Act. 19.5. Act. 15.28 29.</note> So again, upon St. <hi>Pauls</hi> preaching at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> when they heard this, they were <hi>bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in the name of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> Above all this, we find the Scripture telling us, that it was defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Apoſtles Councel thus: <hi>It hath ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed good to the holy Ghoſt, and to us,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that ye abstam from meats offered unto Idols, and from blood, and frous things ſtrangled,</hi> &amp;c. This we ſee is moſt plainly and expreſly defined by the Apoſtles, and as clearly atteſted by Scripture, and yet the Church in after Ages hath thought fit to change that decree, and permit Chriſtians to eat ſtrangled things and blood; nay, you that diſpute againſt the Authority of the Church in matters of Faith, are contented to ſubmit to it in point of eating, you could not otherwiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the eating of a black pudding or ſtrangled Hen, to be a moſt notorions tranſgreſſion, nor could any thing excuſe us from ſin in ſo doing, if the Church h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>d not a power over the Scriptures. And to conclude, if the authority of the Church were not over the Scriptore, then all Jews that ſhould be converted now to the Faith of Chriſt and come to Baptiſm, ſhould be tyed ſtill to the obſervation of <hi>Maſes</hi> his Law; for ſo we finde in Scripture, that the Apoſtles themſelves, and others of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="227" facs="tcp:170406:117"/>
                              <hi>Thou ſeeſt brother, how many thouſands of Jews there are which believe, and they are all zealous for the Law, and they are informed of thee, that thou teacheſt all the Jews which are among the Gentiles, to forſake</hi> Moſes, <hi>Saying,
<note place="margin">Act. 21.18 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25.</note> that they ought not to circumciſe their children, neither to walk after the cuſtums: What is it therefore? the multitude muſt needs come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for they will hear that thou art come. Do therefore this that we ſay unto thee, we have four men which have a vow on them. Them take and purifie thy ſelf with them, and be at chrrges with them, that they may ſhave their heads, and all may know, that thoſe things whereof they were informed concerning thee are nothing, but that thy ſelf alſo walkeſt orderly, and keepeſt the Law. As touching the Geutiles which believe, we have written, and concluded, that they obſerve no ſuch thing, ſave only that they keep themſelves from things offered unto Idols, and from blood, and from things ſtrangled, and from fornica<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>I ſay, that what you urge out of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> makes no more againſt us, then it does againſt the Apoſtles themſelves, from whence we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:170406:118"/>our Traditions: but moſt eſpecially St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who expreſly bids us to <hi>hold faſt the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions which we have received:</hi> Nay, and all the holy Fathers of the Primitive Church, who have always imbraced, and held them. Nay yet further, you do moſt manifeſtly oppoſe and oppugne your own ſelves, who receive the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Scripture, the Lords day, and many holy days, with divers other things which you hold in great reverence, by no other Authority. If therefore we Catholicks offend in ſo doing, then the Apoſtles themſelves, and all the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Fathers and Chriſtians, and you your ſelves are as guilty of a fault; if they be innocent, and you too, why ſhould we be condemned? Again, give me leave to tell you, that you have wholly miſtaken the ſenſe of that Text, and that I will demonſtrate to you out of the context; which runs thus.
<note place="margin">Deu 4.1.2.</note> Now <hi>therefore hearken, O Iſrael, un-the Statutes, and unto the Judgements, which I teach you for to do them, that ye may live, and go in, and poſſeſs the Land, which the Lord God of your Fathers giveth you. Ye ſhall not add unto the word which I command you; neither ſhall you diminiſh ought from it, that ye may keep the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of the Lord your God which I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand you.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, I give unto you precepts both Ceremonial and Judicial, which ye ought perfectly and entirely to keep; for ſo much is ſignified in thoſe words ye ſhall not add nor diminiſh; and this precept to that people, is delivered though in other words, yet to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame ſenſe in divers other places, that they
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:170406:118"/>ſhould be punctual in the obſervation of what was commanded them, and not to ſwerve or turn to the right hand or the left. So that theſe three things are upon the matter all one, that is perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and intirely to keep <hi>Moſes</hi> his precepts,
<note place="margin">Deut. 17.20. Deut. 28.14. Deut. 31.29. Joſu. 1.7.</note> not to turn from them neither to the right hand, nor to the leſt, and laſt of all, neither to add to, nor diminiſh from their obſervation. Which now is plain cannot be ſo underſtood, as if it were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull to add any new precept; for then it had been utterly unlawful to add thoſe new Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical precepts, as Faith in the bleſſed Trinity, the whole buſineſs of Holy Baptiſm, and the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt; which you receive as well as we: but the ſenſe of thoſe Texts muſt be plainly this, that they ought to be very exact in the obſervation of <hi>Moſes</hi> his Laws, not to corrupt them with any addition or dimunition, but to keep them intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; as for example, this was a Moſaical precept.
<note place="margin">Levit. 12.2, 3.</note> If <hi>a woman have conceived ſeed, ann born a man child, then ſhe ſhal be unclean ſeven days, &amp;c. And in the eighth day, the fleſh of his ſoreskin ſhall be circumciſed,</hi> &amp;c. To this precept now, it was not lawful to add or diminiſh from that, it was not lawful, neither before nor after the eigth day to circumciſe the child, nor was the uncleanneſs of the mother to laſt more or leſs than ſeven days. Now the ſame reaſon holds throughout all other precepts, as I ſhall ſhew you in my anſwer to your next Argument. But from what has been ſaid already, it is very evident, that this Text out of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> which you preſs ſo hard, makes nothing at all to the purpoſe, unleſs you can
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:170406:119"/>think this a good Argument. The <hi>Jews</hi> were bound perfectly and entirely to keep the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of <hi>Moſes;</hi> therefore Chriſtians muſt not admit of Apoſtolical Traditions, but be content with only Scripture: which I think no reaſonable man wil take for other than an abſutd and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous conſequence. But that the buſineſs may be more clear, give me leave to ask of you, whether thoſe commands did belong to the Jews only, or to us Chriſtians, as well as they? If to the <hi>Jews</hi> only, why do you alledge that Text againſt us, or why ſhould we be obliged to the obſervation of thoſe precepts? If they belong to us Chriſtians likewiſe, why do not you keep all the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Law? Why do not all the Mankinde amongſt you Circumciſe themſelves? And why do you forbeare the obſervation of all the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the legal Ceremonies? In the laſt place anſwer me, why do you urge the firſt particle of the text againſt us, <hi>you ſhall not add,</hi> and do not in like manner, urge againſt your ſelves, <hi>ye ſhall not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh?</hi> but I fear I have been too long in this.</p>

                           <p>I wonder truly how you can infer from that Text, that nothing is to be done, but what God commands, and all humane precepts to be caſt away. If ſo, what will you ſay of the Jews them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<note place="margin">Jer. 35.6 Acts 15.29.</note> that did with all exactneſs obſerve the Feaſt of Dedication that was no more then a humane precept?

In the next place give me leave to tell you, that the ſence of this place is clean o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe then what you would impoſe upon it. For as in your laſt Argument, you preſt a Text that was to be underſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<note place="margin">Simila.</note> take heed to thy ſelf that thou be not ſnared by following them, and that thou enquire not after their gods,</hi> ſaying, <hi>how did theſe Nations ſerve their gods, even ſo will I do likewiſe.

<pb n="302" facs="tcp:170406:120"/>ſhalt come into Paleſtin, the Land of Promiſe, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou art going, and ſhalt offer to the Lord thy God a Sacrafice, thou ſhalt not imitate the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles that offer their ſons and daughters by fire to their falfe gods, but this thou ſhalt onely offer what I command thee.</hi> To wit, of the Beaſts Sheep, Goats, Kids, Oxen, Calves, Pigeons, Sparrows, Turtles.

                           <p>I ſay you ſtill ſtrangly conclude out of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, and I pray you mark your Argument. All Scripture is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for inſtruction, &amp;c. Therefore all Traditions are unneceſſary. I will give you ſuch another couſequence. All meat is profitable for nouriſhment, therefore drink is unneceſſary. Or thus, all Alms giving is profitable for Salvation,
<note place="margin">Luk. 11.43. Dan. 1.34.</note> as St. <hi>Luke</hi> and the Prophet <hi>Daniell</hi> aſſures us, therefore prayer is to no purpoſe, and the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments themſelves are unneceſſary. Or it may be you intend your Argument thus, all Scripture is profitable, that is ſufficient, therefore Traditions are altogether uſeleſſe. What ſtrange interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Scripture is this? Is to be profitable and ſufficient alone? then mark this conſequence, St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells <hi>Timothy,</hi> that godlineſſe is profitable to all things,
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4.8. 2 Tim. 4.11.</note> therefore all other things are unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. Again the ſame Apoſtle bids <hi>Timothy,</hi> take <hi>Mark</hi> and bring him with him, adding, that he was profitable unto him for the Miniſtry: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Timothy, Titus, Oneſimus</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> that was
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:170406:122"/>then with him, were all unneceſſary. Who ſees not now, that if his Licence may be admitted of interpreting Scripture after this manner, that the whole muſt of neceſſity be corrupted quickly &amp; adulterated. But now that you may more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee your errour, I will ſhew you the whole ſcope of the Apoſtle in theſe words. Firſt in the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Words, he exhorts <hi>Timothr</hi> as a Biſhop, to inſtruct thoſe that are commited to his charge in faith and good works, and to reprove and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince adverſaries who rejected the truth and were men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith, and ſo he addes to ſhew him how he was to do it,
<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.8. ver. 14, 15, 16.</note> theſe words. <hi>But continue thou in the things that thou haſt learned, and haſt been aſſured of, knowing of whom thou haſt learned them,</hi> and that from a Child thou haſt known the holy Scriptures which are able to make thee wiſe unto ſalvation, through faith which is in Chriſt Jeſus, for all Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is given by inſpiration of God, and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, &amp;c. Now here by the Scripture, which he ſays, <hi>Timothy</hi> had known from his Infancy, he muſt needs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Scripture of the Old Teſtament, for at that time when <hi>Timothy</hi> was a child, there could be no Scripture of the new Teſtament ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant. The Apoſtle the refore in the Text ſo ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, all Scripture divinely inſpired, is profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to teach friends to convince adverſaries, but the Scripture of the Old Teſtament, which thou haſt learnt from thy Infancy, is divinely inſpired, there it is ſo, and ſo profitable. In the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:170406:122"/>we under the Goſpell, may agree thus. All Scripture divinely inſpired, is profitable to teach, to reproves &amp;c. But the Scripture of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament is divinely inſpired, therefore it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to teach, reprove, &amp;c. That is, whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is inſtructed in knowledge of that, ſhall find great helps to perform all that now out of theſe Arguments, grounded upon that Text which you urg, we may collect theſe 3 propoſitions to be true. Firſt, that all Scripture divniely inſpired is profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to teach, reprove, &amp;c. 2ly. That the Scripture of the Old Teſtament is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to teach Thirdly, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Old Teſtament is ſo; and ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable likewiſe. So as therefore this does not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Scripture of the Old Teſtament is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uſeleſſe and unneceſſary, ſo neither does this follow. The Scripture of the New Teſtament is profitable, Therefore the Scripture of the Old is altogether uſeleſſe and unneceſſary. Nor can this with more reaſon follow, the Scripture of both Teſtaments New and Old, is ſo and ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, therefore Tradition is altogether uſeleſſe and unneceſſary. Then that which the ſame A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle tells us in another place, I am ſure were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together impertinent, if not impions; When he ſays, hold faſt Traditions.</p>

<pb n="316" facs="tcp:170406:127"/>he ſaid, that it is more bleſſed to give, than to receive; and no ſuch thing, or to that purpoſe, I could find yet, in any of the Goſpels. In like manner, ſome of his moſt confiderable deeds, were not fully deſcribed, or at all ſignified to us, by any of the Evangeliſts, <hi>As that he was ſeen by above five bundred brethren at once,</hi> which St. <hi>Paul</hi> moſt expreſly affirms to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> which apparition of his I could never read any thing of,
<note place="margin">Luke 10.35.</note> as I ſaid before, in any of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpels.</p>
                           <p>Then there are ſome Eccleſiaſtical obſervan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, which you retain ſtill in your Church, that neither are to be found in Scripture, nor is the reaſon apparent to every one, why they were ever invented or uſed; As firſt, that we kneel at our prayers, is not from any command in Scripture, and yet you your ſelves hold it highly neceſſary. Then that we chooſe out of all the corners of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that ſide where the Sun riſeth, towards which to turn our ſelves praying, it is neither in Scripture, nor apparently in reaſon to ordinary capacities, but only that it has been the practice of the univerſal Church.</p>
                           <p>Again we know, as I have ſhewed formerly, in the Old Teſtament,
<note place="margin">Dent. 17. Ezeth. 44.</note> the Law was not the judge of difficulties, but the Prieſt, ſo at large in <hi>Deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teron<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                                    <desc>••</desc>
                                 </gap>y,</hi> and the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> tels us plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the Prieſt; ſhall ſtand in judgement, and they only ſhall judge.</p>
                           <p>Now it is clear, that we admit of Scripture as well as you, but we differ in the underſtanding of it, becauſe you will have your own ſingle judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:170406:127"/>upon it to be your Rule, and we admit no other judge, but that authority which gives it, that is the Church. And this is apparently the reaſon, why all you that are out of the Church do ſo differ amongſt your ſelves upon all points, and principally in that great point, concerning the bleſſed Sacrament, whether it be truly, and ſpiritually the very body and blood of Chriſt, by the figure and ſigns, and the bare letter of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture will never be able to determine betwixt you, and ſo there muſt be an impoſſibility of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord in that, and a hundred things more. Thus we ſee that the Devil himſelf could alledge Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptue againſt our bleſſed Saviour, which was, that God <hi>had given his Angels charge over him, to keep him, &amp;c.</hi> But he malitiouſly miſtook,
<note place="margin">Metth. 4.</note> or through ignorance miſunderſtood, which is not altogether ſo likely the ſenſe of that place. Now whereas you do all pretend that the holy Scriptures are clear, and eaſie to be underſtood of all ordinary Readers, and ſo that lay people, and doting old women may be bold to venter their interpretations, and comments upon it: that is clean contrary to what St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells you, ſpeaking of all the Epiſtles of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in which are ſomething hard to be underſtood, which they that are unlearned and unſtable wreſt as they do alſo the other Scriptures, unto their own deſtruction. Thus do you ſee what un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy miſtakes there were upon St. <hi>Pauls</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings while St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf was yet alive, how much more then muſt there needs be now upon
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:170406:128"/>thoſe grounds that you receive them. Niy St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf tells you, that if his Goſpel be hid, it is hid to them, that are loſt: Now it is plain it cannot be hidden to us, who take the ſenſe and interpretation of the whole Church, you had beſt therefore look to your ſelves, that you be not loſt by hiding of it from your ſelves. And if the bleſſed Fathers of the Church, that were ſo converſant in Scripture, yet underſtood it not in thoſe times, ſo near to the time of Chriſt himſelf, as ſome of you ſay that they did not, how can you preſume upon your ſelves, and ſome late Doctors, that have dared to give you a contrary Doctrine, to what they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to us? I have often meditared upon that place in St. <hi>Lukes</hi> Coſpel, where it is ſaid of the good <hi>Samaritan,</hi> that when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave them to the Hoſt, and ſaid unto him, take care of him, and what ever thou ſpendeſt more, when I come again I will repay thee. Juſt ſo me thinks our Saviour haſt left us two Teſtaments, and whatſoever the Apoſtles, Doctors, and Fathers of the Church have added more, and we ſhall humbly obſerve, he when he comes again, of his great goodneſs will repay us. Now to ſumm up all, it is plain, by this that has been ſaid, that ſome Traditions of the Church muſt have equal authority with Scripture, as the commands of a Prince have equal force and power upon Subjects, whether by word of mouth delivered, or by writing. So the word of God, written or delivered, is ſtill
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:170406:128"/>the word of God, and of equal power. And if you ſay that the Apoſtolical Tradition cannot be the word of God, I ask you whether the other part of the Apoſtles, that have left us nothing in writing, were not as well inſpired of the Holy Ghoſt as they that did: you cannot ſure deny it, and they were too the greater part of the Twelve. Now the Church of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſtill retains many things of their Doctrine, thorgh we have none of their writing, and ſure we are to give as much credit to thoſe that writ not, as thoſe that did. I ask you again, whether it be not a point of faith, that the whole Scripture taken together, of the Old and New Teſtament is the word of God? and again whether all that Scripture, eſpecially in thoſe things which concern Faith, and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be not moſt clear from corruption? and again, that we have the true genuine, and legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate ſenſe of that Scripture, is a point of faith too. I believe you will not deny any one of theſe to be a point of your Faith: I am ſure they are all of mine, ſo you muſt firſt acknowledge that I give as great an honour to Scripture as your ſelf; and then if we both admit thoſe three poſitions, as principles of Faith, we muſt neceſſarily admit of Traditions; for we have no Authority but that to juſtifie them, and if we do not admit thoſe for principles, our Faith it ſelf is wholly vain.</p>
                           <p>Then beſides theſe three principles of Faith, there are others alſo, which we have only by
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:170406:129"/>Tradition, as that the Symbol of our Faith, is Canonical and Apoſtolical. Then that Infants are to be baptized. Then that thoſe who are baptized by Hereticks, are not to be re-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized. Then as is aforeſaid, that the bleſſed Mother of God, alwayes remained a Virgin. Then that in Baptiſm thoſe words ought to be pronounced, <hi>I baptize thee in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost,</hi> and that without them, there can be no valid Baptiſme. Then that there is a certain, and determinate number of Sacraments and what that number is. All theſe things, I ſay, are not clearely to be found in Scripture but we muſt be beholding to the Authority of Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</p>
                           <p>But laſt of all for Eccleſiaſtical Rites and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, it is manifeſt that we can have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther authority but Tradition, and not Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall; for all thoſe neither, but ſome of them only from the Primitive Fathers that ſucceeded the Apoſtles in the Government of Chriſts Church, and that ſure it ſecurity enough for the practice and perſwaſion of any Chriſtian: for I have heard that a very ancient and moſt learned Father ſaid, that it was a piece of moſt inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent madneſſe, to diſpute the doing of that, which the Church of Chriſt throughout the whole world has always frequented, and practiſed; ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                           <p>There were other wicked and idolatrous Kings, as <hi>Abaz, Manaſſes, Amon,</hi> and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wicked, though not idolaters, but yet the uſe of the Divine Sacrifice and worſhip ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Law, does appear ſtill to have remained in the Temple of <hi>Solomon,</hi> til the Babyloniſh captivity, as is evident by ſeveral places of Scripture. Then for the failing of the Synagogue in the time of Chriſt, which you alledge, it is not to be ſuppoſed that they failed from the true faith, which was before profeſt, but ſhe with her ceremonies and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices was turned out of dores, as was before typified in <hi>Abrahams</hi> bondwoman, it does not therefore follow that the Church, the true wife ſhould be ſo too. Then the Synagogue was therefore turned away becauſe it was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perfect, nor ſufficient to ſalvation,
<note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.19.</note> for ſo St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us that the Law brought nothing to perfection, and in that ſenſe the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and Sacraments of the Synagogue, are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the ſame Apoſtle,
<note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.9.</note> weak and beggarly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements, but now the Church of Chriſt is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and ſufficient to ſalvation, becauſe it's Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments which are inſtituted by Chriſt, carry with them a vertue of juſtification, and taking away of ſinnes: the Sacrrments of the old Law, only promiſed a Saviour, but the Sacraments of the new give ſalvation. Again, the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue contained only the ſhadow of future things as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks;

                                 <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.9.</note> but the Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the light it ſelf, which is Chriſt, as St. <hi>Iohn</hi> aſſures us: now the ſhadow muſt neceſſarily
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:170406:130"/>fly before the light; the Synagogue therefore, with the Moſaical Sacrifices, ought to ceaſe when the Church comes with Chriſt. Laſt of all, the Synagogue was inſtituted for ſervants, the Church for ſonnes, now ſervants take wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of their maſters for a time, and ſo are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt by their maſters; but ſonnes ſucceed in the perpetual inheritance, which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles thus inſinſtates to the <hi>Galatians, Gaſt out the bondwoman and her ſonne,

                           <p>In truth methinks it is a very ſad courſe of arguing, that moſt of your Church are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to uſe, that is, if you can find any one Text that is never ſo obſcure, if it can be faſhioned at all for your turn, you will entirely inſiſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, though there be hundreds of clear Texts to the contrary. As for example, This Text you urge out of <hi>Daniel,</hi> is very dark, <hi>That he ſhall cauſe the Sacrifice and oblation to ceaſe.</hi> I am ſure theſe Texts are very clear, <hi>That the gates of hell ſhall not prevail againſt it;</hi> again, <hi>I am alwayes with you to the end of the world;</hi> and again, <hi>I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not;</hi> and again, <hi>The Church is the pillar and foundation of truth:</hi> Theſe Texts I ſay are clear and need no Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter, the other that you quote is ſo obſcure, that the greateſt learning in the world may be at a ſtand, to underſtand it.

                           <p>I grant that the Church is frequently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the Moon, but never as to her failings, but in theſe reſpects following. Firſt, as the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:170406:131"/>Moon in the beginning of the moneth is very litle, and ſo by litle and litle encreaſeth, till ſhe grow full andperfect; ſo the Chriſtian Church in the beginning of its riſe, took up but very litle room, afterward encreaſed and ſpead it ſelf by degrees that at laſt it ſhould dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe it ſelf over the face of the whole world. Secondly, as the Moon receives corporeal light from the Sun, ſo the Church receives its light of faith and holineſs, from the Sun of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that is Chriſt. Thirdly, as the Moon is ſubject to changes, ſo is the Church in this life, for ſometimes ſhe flouriſheth in the ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of peace, ſometimes is oppreſſed with perſecutions, but never totally fayles, it may be clouded for a while, but never quite extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed. You ſee then in what the ſimilitude between the Moon, and the Church conſiſts, and no ſimilitude, as I am informed, is obliged to run upon four feet. The Church cannot at all be like the Moon in her failings, but more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles the earth, as ſhe is likewiſe called in Scripture for her firmneſs, ſtability &amp; unmove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs. Then why ſhould you bring that ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude to the prejudices of the Church, when there are ſo many to the favour and honour of her throughout the ſacred Scripture, where you may find that ſhe is as frequently called the Sun as the Moon, <hi>an encloſed Garden, a Fountain, a Paradiſe, a fair Dove, the City of God, the Land of the living, the woman cloathed with the Sun, the Queen in a veſture of gold,</hi> &amp;c. and many more ſuch honorable titles as thoſe, you cannot but
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:170406:131"/>your own reading find out in Scripture, and thoſe methinks, all dutifull children ſhould be more ready to give to their Mother, then to throw dirt in her face, or to aſperſe her with ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies: as for the honeſty &amp; goodneſs of <hi>Wicklif, Huſs, Luther,</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> I will not meddle, but only ask you, who were the one or two honeſt and godly men, that in the ages before them, did ever ſo contradict the Church? if you know not any ſuch, why do you ſo raſhly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it? if you do, I ſhould deſire you to name them, and let us know whereabouts they lived. Howſoever by your argument you make the Church of Chriſt to be in a worſe condition then the Synagogue of the Jews,
<note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.11.</note> when we know the Church is our Miſtreſs, and the Synagogue but a ſervant, but the Synagogue was never ſo deſerted, that but two onely were to be found in it. Nay in the time of <hi>Elias,</hi>

                           <p>To your laſt argument, and that which you preſume will conclude me, as you have layed
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:170406:132"/>it, I look upon it to be the weakeſt, and leaſt ſignifycant, that you have alledged yet, for truly all thoſe markes of Antichriſt, that you produce upon the Pope, are meer trifles, and tricks of ſome of your Doctors invention and truly would agree better in the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to themſelves, than to his holineſs, and how impoſible it is, that they ſhould be applicable to him, I'le paſs through every particular. The firſt note that you give of Antichriſt is, that he muſt fall away from the faith, now defending of purgatory, invocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſaints, and ſacrifice of the Maſs, cannot be called falling from the faith, becauſe the moſt ancient fathers of the Church, have allways been of that opinion: Your Doctors therefore are moſt manifeſtly fallen from the faith, that ſo expreſſly oppoſe thoſe received Doctrines. The ſecond mark you give of the Beaſt is that he ſhall ſit in the Temple of God, and that you ſay the Pope does, as the head of the Church at <hi>Rome.</hi> Truly I doe humbly conceive the caſe to be very different, between ſitting in the Temple of God at <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> and ſitting in the Church of Chriſt at <hi>Rome.</hi> Antichriſt ſhall ſit in the Temple of <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> and be adored of the Jews, the Pope ſits in the Church of Chriſt at <hi>Rome,</hi> which all you have moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happyly forſaken. The third marke you ſay is, that he ſhall ſhew himſelf as God, and that the Pope plainly does you ſay, whilſt he makes himſelf, the viſible head of Chriſts Church; but ſure that is not all one, as to ſhew himſelf
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:170406:132"/>as God. For <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf ſhewed himſelf, as viſible head, as we have proved already, but onely Antichriſt ſhall ſhew himſelf as God. The fourth marke you make is, to exalt and oppoſe himſelf to and above all that is called God, and that you ſay the Pope does, when he exalts himſelf above all eccleſiaſtical and civil power: here give me leave to tell you that <hi>Moſes</hi> was above all eccleſiaſticall, and civil power, and yet in that he was not exalted above God. Thus four markes of Antichriſt you are pleaſed to take out of the Epiſtle of S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> your fifth marke fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes out of S. <hi>John, That he muſt deny Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> which you ſay the Pope does by the corruption of the doctrine, that concernes the mediation of Chriſt, and introducing of new mediators, but that <hi>I</hi> have proved to be a corruption of yours, as you wil ſee in my laſt paper. The ſixth marke again, you make to be that he is a Lyer and worker of fals mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acles, ſo you ſay the Pope does at <hi>Loretto</hi> and other places. I wonder your underſtanding is ſo weak, as to think, that we think that the Pope does the <hi>Loretto</hi> miracles, but God. If you would prove any thing as to this point you ſhould prove indeed, that the Pope does thoſe very miracles, which the Scripture fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tells that Antichriſt ſhall do,
<note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Revel.</hi> 13.13.15.</note> as that he ſhould make fire come down from heaven on the earth in the ſight of men. Then that he ſhould make the Image of a beaſt to ſpeak &amp;c. neither of theſe miracles, as ever I heard of, hath been
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:170406:133"/>attempted yet by any pope. The ſeventh and laſt marke you give, is that he cauſeth all both ſmall and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark &amp;c. and the pope you ſay plainly does that,
<note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Revel.</hi> 16.13. &amp; <hi>ch.</hi> 14.9.</note> when he impoſeth his Character upon ſome, and marks upon all, as by the Sacrament of confirmation, wherein he uſeth the unction of his Chriſme to ſign the foreheads &amp;c. Here are cleerly three conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons required by the text to the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this mark: firſt that it ſhould be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all great and little, rich and poor, bond and free: Secondly, that he ſhould impoſe his Character either in their foreheads or right hands: Thirdly, that none but he, that has his mark or character, ſhall be priviledged to buy or ſell. Now let any man ſhew that thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions do at all ſuite with the unction of Chriſme and Iſle reſt fully ſatisfied, otherwiſe this argument which you ſo fondly boaſt of, hath no force at all. So according to my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer method, I ſhall be bold to reply, and to conclude your trouble and mina, upon this occaſion.</p>

                           <hi>that he ſaw her coming down out of Heaven prepared as a Bride adorned for her Husband.</hi> And <hi>S. Paul</hi> more largely and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly yet tells the <hi>Epheſians</hi> thus, <hi>Wives ſubmit your ſelves unto your Husbands, as unto the Lord, for the Husband is the head of the Wife, even as
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:170406:134"/>Chriſt is the head of the Church,
<note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27.</note> and he is the Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of the body, therefore as the Church is ſubject unto Chriſt, ſo let the Wives be to their own Husbands in every thing, Husbands love your Wives, even as Chriſt alſo loved the Church, and gave himſelf for it, that he might ſanctify and cleanſe it with the waſhing of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by the word, that he might preſent it to himſelf a glorious Church, not having ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing, but that it ſhould be holy without blemiſh.</hi> Now examine, I pray you, what a prety piece of Chriſtianity it is, to impute impurity and errour to it?</p>
                        <p>Then that the Church is called the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven too,
<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.</note> is as plain by Scripture, firſt out of S.
<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.2, 3.</note> 
                           <hi>Matthews</hi> Goſpell, <hi>For the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven is like unto a man that is an houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder, which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard.</hi> Then again, <hi>The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven is like unto a certain King,
<note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.1, 2, 3.</note> which made a marriage for his Son, and ſent forth his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to call them that were bid to the medding,</hi> &amp;c. Then again, <hi>The Kingdome of heaven ſhall be likned to ten Virgins, which took their lamps and went forth to meet the Bridgroome, and five of them were wiſe, and five were fooliſh,</hi> &amp;c. Many more ſuch Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles we find in the Goſpells, but theſe three will be enough for our purpoſe, to draw from thence theſe three concluſions, firſt, if the Church be called the Kingdome of Heaven, how ſhould errour, falſity, and uncleaneſs raign in it ſo many hundred years, as you pretend it has? when the Kingdome of Heaven we know is the Kingdome of truth and purity. Secondly,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:170406:134"/>It is plain that God goes out even untill the evening to hire labourers whereas you do, and muſt maintain, that none were hired in the Church for above a thouſand years, but your late upſtart Doctors. Thirdly, It is plain that the Church here militant, is a collection of good and bad, for our Saviour ſaies plainly, that of the Virgins, five were wiſe, and five fooliſh, and ſo fiſhes good and bad come to the net of the Church. I beſeech you be pleaſed to make your own application.</p>
                        <p>Over and above all this, I ſhall prove that the Church is not only incapable of errour, becauſe it is the Spouſe of Chriſt, his body, and called the Kingdome of Heaven, but becauſe ſhe is governed by the perpetual preſence, power and authority of the Holy Ghoſt, who is never to forſake her;
<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.</note> and firſt our Saviour promiſeth <hi>that be will ask the Father, and he ſhall ſend another comforter,</hi> and ſo accordingly he did not long after in the ſame Goſpell, <hi>Holy Father,
<note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.11.</note> keep through thine own name thoſe that thou haſt given me,</hi> &amp;c. and he explains himſelf in the ſame cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>ter, that he prayes not for them onely, meaning his Apoſtles, but for them who were afterwards to believe in him through their preaching,
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Does not <hi>S Paul</hi> tell his Diſciple <hi>Timothy,</hi> how he is to behave himſelf in the houſe of God, which is the Church of God, the pillar &amp; ground of truth; how then can it poſſibly erre?</p>
                        <p>Then <hi>S. John</hi> tells us, that our Saviour ſaid that he had many things to ſay unto them, <hi>but
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:170406:135"/>that they could not bear them then, but when the ſpirit of truth ſhould come, he ſhould teach them all truth.</hi> Again the ſame <hi>S. John</hi> in his Epiſtle General tells us,
<note place="margin">1 <hi>John</hi> 2.20.</note> 
                           <hi>that we have an unction from the holy one, and that we know all things, and that we ſhall be alwaies capable to diſtinguiſh a lye from truth,</hi> it muſt be therefore the unction of the holy Ghoſt, that alwaies teacheth the Church.</p>
                        <p>In fine,
<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.20.</note> 
                           <hi>S. Matthew</hi> makes them the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding words of his Goſpel, <hi>Go yet herefore &amp; teach all Nations,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>teaching them to obſerve all things, whatſoever I have commanded you, and loe I am with you alwaies, even to the end of the world. Chriſt who is the way, the truth and the life,</hi> ſaid this to his Diſciples, it is plain therefore that this Church, which is the pillar and ground of truth, that has him for its leader, and the Holy Ghoſt for its teacher, can never erre; how pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable is it then, that it ſhould be in an errour for above a thouſand years together, as you fondly imagine?</p>
                        <p>Then as the Church is but one, ſo it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that unity ſhould be in the Church, I prove out of the expreſs words of S.
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.10.</note> 
                           <hi>Paul, Now I beſeech you brethren, by the name of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, that ye all ſpeak the ſame thing. and that there he no diviſions amongſt you, but that ye be perfectly joyned together in the ſame mind, and in the ſame judgement:</hi> and then in another place in the ſame Epiſtle ſayes,
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.33.</note> 
                           <hi>that God is not the author of confuſion, but of peace, as in all Churches of the Saints.</hi> What then will you ſay for your ſelves, that have nothing but confuſions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:170406:135"/>you? nay is it not more probable that God will rather inſpire his own body, that is the concord and unity of his Church, than any private Doctors whatſoever, that teach a diſſent from it?</p>
                        <p>Nay, how much this unity of his Church is deſired by God himſelf, is evident by what the ſame <hi>S. Paul</hi> writes to the <hi>Romanes,
<note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.4, 5, 6.</note> for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever things are written aforetime, were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures, might have hope; Now the God of patience and conſolation, grant you to be like minded one towards another; according to Chriſt Jeſus, That ye may with one mind, and one mouth glorify God; even the father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. Again the ſame Apoſtle in the ſame Epiſtle laies an injunction upon the <hi>Romanes,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.16.</note> whoſe faith he acknowledged before, was celebrated over the whole world, <hi>that they ſhould be of the ſame mind, one towards another, not to mind high things, but condeſcend to men of low eſtate, and not to he wiſe in their own conceits,</hi> which all they are, and muſt be, that are out of the Church.</p>
                        <p>Obſerve I pray you, the moſt pathetical ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation of S. <hi>Paul</hi> to this purpoſe;
<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.1, 2.</note> 
                           <hi>If there be therefore any conſolation in Chriſt, if any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of love, if any fellowſhip of the ſpirit, if any bowells of mercy, fulfill ye my joy, that ye be like minded, having the ſame love, being of one accord, of one wind.</hi> Nay, the breach of this peace, unity, and unanimity in Gods Church, is moſt paſſionately, if it be lawfull to ſay ſo,
<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Jerem.</hi> 2.12, 13.</note> bewail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God himſelf, as the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:170406:136"/>it, nay, propoſeth it as a matter of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement to Heaven it ſelf; <hi>be aſtoniſhed, O ye Heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid, be ye very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate, ſaith the Lord; foy my people have committed two evils, they have forſaken me, the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out ciſterns, broken ciſterns, that can hold no water.</hi> I pray you ſeriouſly exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine with your ſelf, whether you do leſſe, by leaving off the Church, the true and living fountain, and digging to your ſelves broken ciſterns, out of <hi>Wicklif, Huſs, Luther, Calvin,</hi> &amp;c. In vain ſure hath God ſent his Son, in vain the Holy Ghoſt, and yet more in vain hath he ſent Apoſtles, Martyrs, Confeſſors, Doctors, in all ages, to perpetuate the truth of his Church to us, when a few of ſuch precious perſons as thoſe of yours would have ſerved the turn. Here are only two things now as I conceive, left to be cleared, the one is, that the Prelates, and principal Perſons of Chriſts Church aſſembled together, do make the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative body of the whole Church; the other is, that the Romane Catholick Church, is that univerſal Church, diſperſt over the whole world. As to the firſt, it is ſufficiently clear, by many ſuch Scriptures as thſe, <hi>And he ſtood and bleſſed all the congregation of Iſrael, with a loud voice,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And the King and all Iſrael with him, offered Sacrifice before the Lord;</hi> now that this muſt be onely meant of the body repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> is plain to ſenſe, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly expreſt in the beginning of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Then Solomon aſſembled the Elders of Iſrael,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:170406:136"/>and all the heads of the Tribes, the chief of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Children of Iſrael unto King Solomon in Jeruſalem,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.58.62.1.</note> Thus it is plain, that the heads of the Church aſſembled, repreſent the body of the whole Church.</p>
                        <p>Then as to the clearing of the next point I muſt tell you a great miſtake amongſt you, for you commonly ſpeaking of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> take it only for the particular Church, which formerly was, and ſtill is there, and ſo it is no more indeed than particular. But if you take it for the collection of all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, who being diſperſt over all the world, did in old daies alwaies adhere, and ſtill do to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſo it is called Catholick or Univerſal, becauſe diffuſed over the whole world, and it is called <hi>Romane</hi> from the moſt noble part, the head of it: and that ſhe muſt be that Univerſal, and for ever viſible Church of Chriſt, is plain, becauſe ſhe ever has been ſo. Let any man ſhew, that any other Church has continued without errour or interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and I will grant you all that you have ſaid, and can more require of me. But if it be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that no one Church of Chriſt in the world has continued without errour, or interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but onely ſhe, it muſt follow, that ſhe is the onely true Church of Chriſt. Firſt the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church has been long ſince more then inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, quite abrogated. The <hi>Turkiſh</hi> or <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humetan</hi> has not always been. The <hi>Liaheran, Calvinian,</hi> and reformed Church of <hi>England,</hi> are all new; for they began with pretended
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:170406:137"/>reformation, which was made by them, and other particular Doctors, ſo muſt of neceſſity imply novelty: The <hi>Roman</hi> onely has perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in its own place, and ancient profeſſion, ſo muſt be for ever the Mother and Miſtreſs of our faith, as taught by the Spirit of God. If any of you will ſay, that your Church, or any other, their <hi>Church,</hi> has continued viſible, and without errour, I beg the favour onely to know by what name ſhe was called, and is, what parts of the world ſhe has poſſeſt, &amp; does? what paſtors and Biſhops ſhe has had, and ſtill has? what Kings and Emperours have adhered to her, and ſtill do? What Hereticks have been condemned by her? What Univerſities ſhe hath confirmed? What Churches and Monaſteries built? If none of this can be ſhown, you muſt give me leave to perſiſt in my former per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion. Now though I conceive enough ſaid in my anſwer before, as to the buſineſs of the popes being Anti-chriſt, and that no obligation at all lyes upon me, to prove a negative, yet becauſe that is ſo great a gudgeon, and ſo vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly ſwallowed, I ſhall undertake the taske a little further.</p>
                        <p>That you may better underſtand this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie concerning Anti-chriſt, you muſt know that the name of Anti-chriſt ſignifies, as I am informed, an enemy, or adverſary to Chriſt, and that muſt be underſtood in a two fold manner: firſt generally for any enemy of Chriſt, as all Hereticks are, and in that ſenſe, we are to underſtand the Apoſtle who tells us,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:170406:137"/>
                           <hi>that even now there are many Antichriſts,</hi> that is many Hereticks, that think evilly, and malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly of Chriſt, of whom it follows in the Text <hi>They went cut from us, but they are not of us:</hi> and again in another chapter of the ſame Epiſtle, <hi>And every ſpirit that confeſſeth not,
<note place="margin">1 <hi>John</hi> 4.3.</note> that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh, is not of God, and this is that ſpirit of Antichriſt, whereof you have heard, that it ſhould come, and even now already it is in the world.</hi> Secondly, it is taken ſpecially, for the principall and grandeſt adverſary of Chriſt, of whom all the reſt before ſpoken of, are but forerunners: and of this grand Antichriſt it is that S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, when he ſays,
<note place="margin">2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2, 3, 4.</note> 
                           <hi>unleſs that man of ſin be revealed, the ſon of perdition, who oppoſeth and exalteth himſelf above all that is called God, &amp;c.</hi> Now firſt I ſhall prove, that this ſpecial Antichriſt is not yet come at all: for it is agreed upon by all the learned, that the Antichriſt ſhall not come, till after the overthrow, and deſolation of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and they ground themſelves upon thoſe expreſs places in <hi>Daniel</hi> and the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Dan</hi> 2.7. <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.</note> but now we know that the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire is not yet over thrown, therefore Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt cannot be yet come. Then we finde in the <hi>Revelation,
<note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.3.6.</note> I will give power unto my two wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and they ſhall propheſie a thouſand two hundred and threeſcore dayes, clothed in ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloath, who ſhall have power to ſhut up heaven that it rain not in the dayes of their propheſie, and have power over waters to turn them into blood,</hi> &amp;c. but theſe two witneſſes are not yet come,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:170406:138"/>fore Antichriſt cannot yet be come himſelf. In the ſecond place, I am to prove that the Pope is not Antichriſt, and firſt, as before, Antichriſt is not to come, but after the ruine of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> Empire, but the Pope came and ſtill is, in the flouriſhing condition of the <hi>Romane</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. Then Antichriſt is to kill thoſe two wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes or Prophets, before ſpoken of, but this the Pope has not done, therefore. Then again, Antichriſt is not to reign above three years and a half,
<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.25. <hi>Re.</hi> 11.2. <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.3.</note> as firſt the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> informes us, <hi>for a time, and times, and half a time,</hi> and in the <hi>Revelation</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>for forty and two moneths in one place,</hi> and <hi>a thouſand two hundred and threeſcore dayes</hi> in another place: but now the Pope has raigned for many ages. Again, the Antichriſt is to be received by the <hi>Jews</hi> for their <hi>Meſſiah,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>John</hi> 7.43. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 10.</note> as both <hi>S. John</hi> and <hi>S. Paul</hi> do te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie, but the Pope I am ſure never yet was, and very improbable it is, that he will ever be received by them for their <hi>Moſſiah.</hi> Laſtly, Antichriſt is to make fire come down from Heaven,
<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.13.</note> as we ſee ſaid in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> but none of this, has the Pope ever done, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he can never be thought to be Antichriſt.</p>
                        <p>Thus I have been bold to inlarge upon this particular, it being ſo vulgar an errour, and the grand pretext of all the ſchiſme and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie in the whole world, for to juſtifie their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection from the Biſhop of <hi>Rome:</hi> and indeed it was a very artificial trick of the Devil, and ſome of your Doctors, to faſten that dirt upon him, for who will be ſo mad to keep in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:170406:138"/>with that man of ſin, or the Antichriſt, as moſt of your common people do moſt igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly preſume him to be.

                  <head>THE DIPPER DROWNED By endeavouring to wade in the unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom'd depths of Scripture, &amp;c.</head>
                  <p>Mris <hi>N.</hi> had no ſooner received theſe pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, but ſhe went immediately with them to her husband the Doctor, imploring his advice, and aſſiſtance in the management of hir further diſcourſes with my Lady. The Doctor was at this time fallen into ſome indiſpoſition of body, notwitnſtanding he took the pains to look haſtily over them, and then called his wife to him, and told her after this manner.</p>
                  <p>Indeed ſweet-heart you have done very ill, to engage your ſelf in any buſineſs of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, without my knowledge and approbation, for what you have ſaid, or done amiſs in it, wil be all imputed to me, though utterly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and innocent in the matter. And I muſt tell you, that you have ventured very boldly upon ſome main points, in which the moſt learned Doctors in the world, are yet to ſeek for ſatisfaction: and again give me leave to
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:170406:141"/>tell you, that you charge the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> with ſome things, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> does not; and ſo inſtead of healing up thoſe breaches that are betwixt us, which ſhould be all our endeavours to do, you have made the wounds wider, and differences greater, then indeed they are: and that truly is no ſmall fault amongſt us all. Then laſt of all, I fear you have hazarded much of that good opinion, that my Lady had of us, by entring the liſt with her upon this occaſion, and that intereſt we had in her, was not a little conſiderable, being ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent a neighbour, and eſpeciall a friend, as ſhe has always been to us, ſo for my part I will have nothing to do in the buſineſs, but as you begun, you ſhall e'n make an end without me; but if you muſt needs be ſcribling of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, and dabling in divinity, I'le let you a task, and you may offer it to my Lady, if you pleaſe, and you are both, I perceive ſo good Scripturiſts, as that I may entruſt you with it, it is a Paper that I received from Mr. <hi>R.</hi> the grand Patriarch of all the Anabaptiſt: in theſe parts, I will write a Letter to my Lady, to beg her excuſe of me, for not waiting on her Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip at dinner.</p>
                  <p>Mr is. <hi>N.</hi> not a little troubled to finde no better acceptation of her zealous and painful endeavours, for my Ladies converſion, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unwilling to move her husband further at that time, took the Anabaptiſts paper from him ſo left him to his other ſtudies, and ſhe betook her ſelf to her houſhold occaſions.</p>
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:170406:141"/>
                  <p>The next morning early, ſhe made her ſelf ready to wait on my Lady, that ſhe might have ſome private diſcourſe with her Ladyſhip be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore dinner, ſo calling for her husbands letter, ſhe took her walk, and comming to my Ladies houſe, ſhe found her in her Kitchin, giving orders about dinner, and directing her ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, how to employ themſelves, in the other affairs of her family. My Lady, begging par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for her being ſurprized in that place, and poſture, took Mrs. <hi>N.</hi> along with her to her chamber, where after ſhe had delivered her husbands letter, they fell to read the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts paper, which when they had done, my Lady willingly undertook the task, to joyn with her in the anſwer, but what ſhall we doe with the Latine that is here ſaid my Lady? O for that Madam, replyed Mrs. <hi>N.</hi> my husband will direct us, and has promiſed us all his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance in this, though he does not approve our other diſputes at all. Nay further he ſayes, that when we have anſwered in our way, he will anſwer it too in his. Well then, replied my Lady, we will not trouble him till we have done, for I have a Kinſman in my houſe, that will be able to give us the Engliſh of his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine: and ſo they fell to work immediately, and in two or three meetings more, they made an end of the buſineſs, in this manner as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
                  <div type="part">

                     <head>That to build or to uſe Steeple-houſes (which you call Churches) in the ſervice of God, is altogether unlawfull, much more to beautifie or adorn them, and to give privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, lands or poſſeſsiens to them, or to the perſons of your Churchmen, but that we are all Prieſts equally, and that your Canonical hours and prayers in thoſe Churches, are utterly unlawfull too; I prove by Scripture thus.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. FIrſt, we find that <hi>Stephen</hi> in the latter end of his Sermon, and in the words fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going his death, expreſly declares againſt the vanity of all Temples, or Churches, call them what you pleaſe,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Acts</hi> 7.48, 49, 50.</note> and quotes the Prophet for it. <hi>Howbeit the Moſt High dwelleth not in Temples made with hands,</hi> as ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Heaven is my Throne, and earth is my footſtool, what houſe will ye build me, ſaith the Lord? or what is the place of my reſt? hath not my hands made all theſe things,</hi> &amp;c. From hence it is plain, that God delights not in any of your Steeple-houſes.</p>
                     <p>Again, we find <hi>Paul</hi> as plainly declaiming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Idolatry of all Steeple-houſes, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the <hi>Athenians,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Acts</hi> 17.24, 25.</note> that God that made the world and all things therein, ſeeing that he is Lord of Heaven and earth, <hi>dwelleth not in Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples made with hands, neither is he worſhipt with mens hands,</hi> &amp;c. Thus you ſee how in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:170406:142"/>of Chriſtianity, there were not onely no ſteeple-houſes, but by Scripture expreſly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biden that there ſhould be any.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> bids us again,
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.</note> 
                        <hi>to pray always in all places, holding up pure hands,</hi> what need have we more of Churches and ſteeole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes to pray in, than in any other roomes?</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Nay finde we not our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt himſelf propheſying the deſtruction of that Idoll of the <hi>Jews</hi> their Temple to ſay,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Matt</hi> 24.2.</note> 
                        <hi>Verely Verely I ſay unto you there ſhall not be left heer one ſtone upon another that ſhall not be throwne down,</hi> You may ſee then what pleaſure he tooke in that place, which was the gloriouſeſt of the whole world, what then will become of your pittifull Temples and ſteeple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes?</p>
                     <p n="5">5 Our Saviour yet more plainly ſhews his diſtaſt of that kinde of worſhip, when he tells the woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> in S. <hi>Johns</hi> Goſpell.
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>John.</hi> 4.21.23.</note> 
                        <hi>Women believe me, The hour cometh, when ye ſhall neither in this mountain nor yet at Hieruſalem wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the Father &amp;c. But the hour cometh, and now is when the true worſhipers ſhall worſhip the Father in ſpirit and in truth, for the Father ſeeketh ſuch to worſhip him.</hi> Heer it is plain that he will not have his worſhip confined to places, no not to his holy Temple.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 Then does not the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> heat down the fond confidence that the Jews had in their Temple, when he bids them not to truſt in lying words, ſaying,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.7.</note> 
                        <hi>The Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:170406:143"/>Lord;</hi> it is plain he ſays, that to call that the Temple of the Lord, was to give lying words.</p>
                     <p n="7">7 Is not God in every place, and can there be any one place ſhewed, where he is properly preſent, but he is always ready to hear ſinners every where, as is frequently ſayd in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, what need have we then of your Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, or ſteple houſes? Nay did not Jeſus Chriſt live a poor life upon earth, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell poverty to all the followers of him, what need have we then of all thoſe ſplendid ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous buildings, and ſtatly ornaments and rich revenues of your Churches; which are but golden ſnares, for to entrap Chriſtian ſouls, and our Saviour himſelf declared as aforeſaid how much he abhorred, and did afterwards de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the riches of <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple, and a heathen Poet himſelf could ſay, <hi>at vos dicite Pontifices, in ſacro quid facit aurum nempe quod &amp; veneri donatae a virginie puppe.</hi> Yet you will perſiſt in that fooliſh idolatry.</p>
                     <p n="8">8 Then that your Churches, nor your Churhmen are to be priviledged, or exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the jurisdiction of the ſecular power more than others, I prove by the expreſs precept and preſident of our Saviour, who not onely ſuffered himſelf to be judged by <hi>Pontius Pilat</hi> a meer lay man,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>John</hi> 19.11.</note> and a heathen, but aproved his power, granting expreſsly to him, <hi>that his power was given him from above,</hi> what reaſon then have any of your Churchmen to refugiate themſelves under any pretended
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:170406:143"/>priviledge, or be exempted from the ſecular power more than we?</p>
                     <p n="9">9 Nay that all faithfull Chriſtians are Prieſts, and the Lords Anointed, and that by Baptiſme it ſelf,
<note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5 9.</note> is plain by many expreſs Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. And therefore <hi>Peter</hi> twice in one chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter inculcates it thus. firſt, <hi>ye allſo as lively ſtones are built up a ſpirituall houſe, an holy preiſthood to offer up Spirituall Sacrifice, acceptable to God by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and again, <hi>but ye are a choſen genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a Royall Preiſthood an holy nation, a peculiar people, that ye ſhould ſhew forth the praiſes of him, who hath called you out of darkneſs into his marvelous light?</hi> By which it is plain that all good Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ians are as much prieſts as any of your black coats what ſoever, and this is likewiſe affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>John,</hi> who tells us <hi>that he loved us and waſhed us from our ſins in his blood, and made us a Kingdome, and prieſts to God his Father.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p n="10">10 Then the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>that by one Spirit we are all baptiſed into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free, and have been all made to drink into one ſpirit,</hi> it muſt follow therefore,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Rem.</hi> 12</note> that we are equally Preiſts with any of you. Nay does not the ſame Apoſtle tell us yet more plainly, that we may do the office of Prieſts? which is to offer Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, when he chargeth us: <hi>to preſent our bodys a living Sacrifice, holy acceptable unto God, which is our reſonable ſervice,</hi> and cannot we do that as well as you?</p>
                     <p n="11">11. Laſt of all for your Canonicall hours and formall prayers in your Churches, and by
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:170406:144"/>your pretended preiſts, I can for my part finde as little aggreeable to Scripture, for firſt our Saviour to diſcountenance that kinde of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Matt.</hi> 7.</note> tells us plainly, <hi>that not every one that ſays unto him Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven.</hi> Then if that kinde of praying were of any uſe or force with God at all, then the Lord would be in a manner neceſſitated and conſtrained to his actions, by thoſe prayers, but that we know he cannot be? Over and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, if ſuch praying were prevalent with God, what need will there be of living in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his Law, or of any good works at all?</p>
                     <p n="12">12. Again our ſaviour Chriſt tells us, <hi>that our Father in heaven knowes what is needfull for us:
<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Matt-</hi> 6.</note> before we aske him,</hi> to what purpoſe therefore ſhould we pray at all to him? onely do his will and leave the reſt to his own goodneſs. For ſo the Prophet <hi>Malachy</hi> aſſures us likewiſe,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Malac.</hi> 3.13.</note> that they are his own words, <hi>I am God and am not to be changed?</hi> You gain nothing therefore upon his decrees, by your prayers?</p>
                     <p n="13">13. Then that our Saviour Chriſt was clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt that kind of praying, appears by thoſe words,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Matt.</hi> 6.</note> 
                        <hi>but when ye pray, uſe not vain repetitions, as the Heathens do, for they think that they ſhall be heard for their much ſpeaking.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Methinks you ſhould therefore be aſhamed of your many repetitions, and prayers, at your Canonical hours forſooth, when you know that there is no ſuch thing as Canonical hours com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and beſides that nothing ſhould be
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:170406:144"/>read or ſaid in any congregation, but what is for the edification of Chriſtians ſouls.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="part">
                     <head>That it is not lawfull to make war with <hi>Turks, Jewes, Heathens</hi> or <hi>Heritcks,</hi> or to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute them for any cauſe of conſcience; nay, that Chriſtians cannot juſtify to make war at all, or to bear any civil Magiſtracy whatſoever, or give or take any oaths, I prove by expreſs Scripture thus.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. Firſt it is plain that to wage war againſt <hi>Turks, Jews, Heathen,</hi> or <hi>Hereticks,</hi> is to reſiſt the will of God, and his holy Sprit viſiting our ſins upon us, and puniſhing us by their hands, and our duty is to fight with prayers and tears, not with the the ſword: As the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles did.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Then we finde our Saviour Expreſly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid, all kinde of reſiſtance, and returns of inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for injury, when he ſays in <hi>Matthews</hi> goſpel.
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Matt.</hi> 4.39.</note> 
                        <hi>But I ſay unto you that ye reſiſt not evil, but whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhall ſmite thee on the right cheek, turn to him the other alſo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. Nay more expreſly yet, we have it in the ſame Goſpell,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.52.</note> 
                        <hi>Then ſayd Jeſus unto him put up again thy ſword into his place, for all they that take the ſword ſhall periſh by the ſword</hi> and that this was ſo underſtood by the Apoſtles &amp; primitive Chriſtians, is plainly held forth by <hi>John</hi> in his
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:170406:145"/>
                        <hi>Apockalyps</hi> where it is ſaid,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.10</note> 
                        <hi>he that leadeth into captivity, ſhall go into captivity, he that killeth with the ſword, muſt be killed with the ſword, heer is the patience and the faith of the ſaints</hi> ſo that all war muſt be ſimply and of it ſelf unlawful?</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Then we find that perſecution for cauſe of conſcience, is utterly unlawfull, for the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and primitive Chriſtians did never ſeek to princes, to give them any force to defend them againſt any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>erſecutors whatſoever, nor do we find the Goſpell, or Apoſtles teach us any thing but ſubmiſſion to our Sufferings, and that all the enemies of Chriſt are to be over come onely <hi>with the ſword of the ſpirit, which is the word of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Lord in <hi>Matthews</hi> Goſpell commands again expreſly, that the Tares which the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſowed ſhould not be pulled up,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Matt.</hi> 13.30.</note> 
                        <hi>but that both be let to grow together till the Harveſt, that is the end of the world and then he will ſay to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, gather ye together firſt the tares, and binde them in bundells to burn them, but gather the wheat into my barne.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. Then that no civil magiſtracy is to be born amongſt Chriſtians,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Luke.</hi> 22.25.</note> is plain out of <hi>Lukes</hi> Goſpell, when the Lord ſaid unto them, <hi>the Kings of the earth exerciſe Lordſhip over them &amp;c.

                           <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.5.</note> where he tells us that there is but one Lord, one Faith, and one Baptiſme, if therefore there is to be but one Lord, who? who ſhall dare to make more? ſo that Kings, Princes and Magiſtrates, are all unlawfull things.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Laſt of all, that it is abſolutely unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for Chriſtians to give or take Oaths, is moſt evident out of our Saviours own words, recited at large in <hi>Matthews</hi> Goſpell thus,

                              <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19, 20.</note> Baptiſing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt, teaching them to obſerve all things whatſoever I have commanded you.</hi> So <hi>Matthew</hi> renders his words,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.15, 16.</note> and <hi>Mark</hi> not much different, <hi>Goe ye into all the world, and preach the Goſpell to every creature, he that believeth and is baptiſed ſhall be ſaved, but he that believeth not ſhall be damned:</hi> by both which Goſpells it is evident that they who would be baptiſed, ought firſt to be taught, and to believe, but In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants for their want of age, are neither capable of learning, not of faith, therefore they are not capable of Baptiſme.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. We find it as plain likewiſe in the practiſe of the Apoſtles: firſt we ſee that <hi>Philip</hi> preached the Goſpell a long while to the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> Eunuch bofore he was baptiſed,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Acts</hi> 8.35, 36, 37.</note> and when he was ſufficiently inſtructed he ſaid, <hi>here is water what does hinder me to be baptiſed, and Philip ſaid,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:170406:146"/>if thou believeſt with all thy heart, thou mayeſt, and he anſwered and ſaid, I believe that Jeſns Chriſt is the Son of God, and ſo he was baptiſed:</hi> thus you ſee how his expreſs belief, was to goe before his baptiſme: and ſo you may ſee how the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poll was preached to <hi>Cornelius</hi> by <hi>Peter,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Acts</hi> 10.</note> before he would baptiſe him, all which ſufficiently argues the madneſſe of your Pedo-baptiſme, wherein their is an utter incapacity of hearing, learning, or believing.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Over and above theſe expreſs Scriptures, I'le give you one argument or two out of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Firſt, you will grant that Reprobates are not to be baptiſed, but many Infants are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates, therefore they are not to be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſed.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Then why did the Ancient Primitive Chriſtians adminiſter Baptiſme but at certain times, and that but thrice a year, if that Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were to be baptiſed ſo ſoon as they were born?</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Laſtly, The Scripture ſpeaks not one word of baptiſing of Children, but one pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Pope <hi>Nicholas,</hi> as we find in Hiſtory, begun that childiſh Baptiſme, and you have been all dotards, twice Children, and Pope-ridden e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſince.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. As for the Character that you pretend to in Baptiſme, it is altogether as ſottiſh and vain a thing. A Character is a meer Popiſh fiction likewiſe, of which there is no mention at all made in Scripture, how can we then imagine it to be any thing more than a meer figment?
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:170406:147"/>eſpecially ſince, if it could be true, it would would prove to be of ſuch importance.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Then to conclude, I pray you conſider a little impartially with your ſelf, what a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid rediculous doctrine it is, that water ſhould be capable to impreſſe ſuch a ſeal upon a ſoul, as to ſtamp an indeleble character, upon an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material thing, <hi>Spectatum admiſſi riſum tene atis Amici.</hi>

                        <p>We grant that our Saviour commands us not to reſiſt evil, but that command ſure is not abſolute, that we ſhould never reſiſt evil, but ſo often as we are ſtruck on one ſide to offer the other alſo, for then neither Chriſt nor his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles had been ſo perfect: for Chriſt, when he was ſtruck on one ſide before the Chief Prieſt, did not turn t'other, but rather reſiſted by a rebuke, <hi>If I have ſpoken well,

Nor can it any way follow from hence, that war is unlawfull, for the invader, as well as the defender, ought not to make war out of any private affection, to revenge, but out of a right intention for the publick good, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe war muſt be unlawfull indeed.</p>

                        <p>We find two parts of your argument to be anſwered to, the firſt is, Chriſts command to <hi>Peter, Put up thy Sword again into his place,</hi> then give us leave to tell you, that Chriſt ſpeaks not of war at all, but meekly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends <hi>Peter</hi> for theſe reaſons: firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all the Apoſtles had askt leave to ſtrike and healone without ſtaying for Chriſts an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <hi>drew his Sward, and wounded a ſervant of the High Prieſts.</hi> Secondly, becauſe it was a raſh and indiſcrect thing, that one man ſhould aſſault ſuch a multitude of armed men. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe if it had been neceſſary, our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our could have commanded Angels to have ſo defended him, as he tells him, <hi>I can ask the Father, and he will ſend me more then twelve legions of Angels,</hi> &amp;c. Fourthly, becauſe he would not have his death hindred, as he ſaid, <hi>The Cup which the Father hath given me wilt thou not that I drink?</hi> All this hinders not, but that war may notwithſtanding be lawfull, if the juſt conditions of war be obſerved. The ſecond part of your argument conſiſts in thoſe words, both out of the Goſpell and <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> he that <hi>killeth with the Sword, muſt periſh or be killed with the Sword,</hi> which cannot be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood ſimply to be true, for we know the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and that many bloody men die in their beds; but both our Saviour and the Apoſtle, alledge an old Law out of the Text, <hi>whoſoever

                     <p>All this is plainly made good by our bleſſed Saviour in the Goſpells, where we find, that they brought young Children to him, that he ſhould touch them, but his Diſciples re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked them that brought them, but when Jeſus ſaw it he was much diſpleaſed, and ſaid to them,

<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.20. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.</note> This the Apoſtle confirmes again to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> when he tells them, <hi>for as in Adam all dye</hi> (that is chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

                     <p>Then we finde that the Apoſtles did uſually baptiſe whole families and houſholds,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Ags</hi> 16.14.</note> as in the <hi>Acts Lydia</hi> was baptiſed and her houſhold, and St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaies, he baptiſed the houſhold of <hi>Stephanus</hi> &amp;c.
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.16.</note> now in thoſe houſholds there were undoubtedly children too, and this has been always ſo univerſally practiſed in the Church, that no ſober Chriſtians can doubt the truth of it.</p>
                     <p>And if there be yet any room for a doubt, be pleaſed to take this argument along with you. <hi>Whoever are capable of juſtifying grace may by Sanctifying grace be freed from original Sin,</hi> and ſo by conſequence muſt be capable of the remedy of originall ſin, and that is biptiſme: b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t infants are capable of juſtifying grace, as is plain in the example of <hi>S. John Baptiſt,</hi> of whom it is ſaid that he was ſanctifyed &amp; filled with the holy Ghoſt from his mothers womb. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſure children muſt be thought capable of the remedy againſt original ſin, and that is bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme. <hi>So</hi> now I ſhall proceed to prove ſome thing of the character imprinted on our ſouls by Baptiſme, which it ſeems gives your party ſomuch ſcandall.</p>
                     <p>Now that this character of ours is plainly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured and ſpoken of in the old Teſtament, as firſt in <hi>Exodus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">

<pb n="247" facs="tcp:170406:164"/>and on the uper dore-poſts of the houſes, where the paſſover was to be eaten that ſo the deſtroying Angel might paſs them by. So Chriſt in Baptiſme, by the merit of his blood, does ſign the ſide poſts, and uper dore poſts of our ſouls, that they may be preſerved from the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of the devil.</p>
                     <p>Again, we find that this Chriſtian character of ours, was perfectly prefigured in the mark which <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>Ez.</hi> 9.4. by Gods command, <hi>v.</hi> 6. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto him, go through the midſt of Jeruſalem, and ſet</hi> T. <hi>a mark upon the foreheads of the men that ſigh, &amp; that cry for all the abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, that be done in the midſt thereof,</hi> &amp; a little after, when the Lord commanded to ſlay utterly both old &amp; young, both maids &amp; little children, but charged them not to come near any one upon whom was the mark, you may obſerve by the way, that the mark was to be ſet upon young as well as old &amp; little children too, to be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the hands of the deſtroyer, &amp; that mark T then ſpoken of, is preſumed by all the learned, to be the Tipe of our character in Baptiſme. Then this mark is moſt clearly propheſied of, &amp; expreſt by the Prophet <hi>Iſay</hi> 66.18, 19. where ſpeaking of the converſion of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> &amp; the future glory &amp; ſanctity of the Chriſtian Church, he ſaith, <hi>It ſhall come that I will gather all nations &amp; tongues, &amp; they ſhal come &amp; ſee my glory, &amp; I will ſet a ſign among them, &amp; I will ſend thoſe that eſcape of them unto the Nations to Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhith, Pul, &amp; Lud, that draw the bow, to Tubal, &amp; Javan, &amp; the Iſles afar off, that have not heard my fame, neither have ſeen my glory, &amp; they ſhal declare my glory among the Gentels.</hi> Hear the Prophet plainly forſees &amp; propheſies the ſending of the Apoſtles &amp; Diſciples into <hi>Africa</hi> &amp; <hi>Jndia,</hi> as well as <hi>Europe</hi> and that this ſign or character which we treat of, ſhall be eſtabliſht amongſt all Chriſtians:</p>
                     <p>But now the new Teſtament is ſo plain &amp; expreſs in this
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:170406:165"/>point that we admire how any knowing Chriſtian can diſpute it. Firſt St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaies to the <hi>Epheſians.</hi> 1.13 14. <hi>in whom alſo after that ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leived, ye were ſealed with the holy Spirit of promiſe, which is the earneſt of our inheritance &amp;c.</hi> by which text it is evident that the faithfull in the regeneration of Baptiſme are ſigned, ſealed, and marked by the holy Ghoſt, that the ſheep of Jeſus Chriſt may be known and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſht from others.</p>
                     <p>Again the ſame <hi>Apoſtle</hi> repeats in the ſame Epiſtle <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.30 <hi>Grieve not the holy Spirit of God whereby ye are ſealed unto the day of redemption,</hi> that ſealing of the holy Ghoſt is the only character that we ſpeak of, and which is ſeems, gives you ſo much ſcandall</p>
                     <p>St. <hi>Iohn.</hi> in like manner is very large in his diſcourſe upon this ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Chriſtian, in his whoſe book of his <hi>Revelation</hi> 7.2 3. but particularly in one place produceth, <hi>an Angel aſcending out of the Eaſt and haveing the ſeal of the living God, crying with a loud voice to the four Angells, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the Sea, and ſaying hurt not the earth neither Sea, nor the treas, till we have ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſervants of our God in their foreheads,</hi> what is that ſeal I pray but our moſt ſacred Chriſtian Character, which we receive in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme?</p>
